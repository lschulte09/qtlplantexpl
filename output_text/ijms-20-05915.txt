Abstract: Soybean is an excellent source of vegetable protein and edible oil. Understanding the
genetic basis of protein and oil content will improve the breeding programs for soybean. Linkage
analysis and genome-wide association study (GWAS) tools were combined to detect quantitative
trait loci (QTL) that are associated with protein and oil content in soybean. Three hundred and eight
recombinantinbred lines (RILS) containing 3454 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and
200 soybean accessions, including 94,462 SNPs and indels, were applied to identify QTL intervals
and significant SNP loci. Intervals on chromosomes 1, 15, and 20 were correlated with both traits,
and QTL 4Prol5-1,4Pro20-1, and q0il5-1 reproducibly correlated with large phenotypic variations.
SNP loci on chromosome 20 that overlapped with qPro20-1 were reproducibly connected to both
traits by GWAS (p < 10-4). Twenty-five candidate genes with putative roles in protein and/or oil
metabolisms within two regions (qPro15-1, qPro20-1) were identified, and eight of these genes showed
differential expressions in parent lines during late reproductive growth stages, consistent with a
role in controlling protein and oil content. The new well-defined QTL should significantly improve
molecular breeding programs, and the identified candidate genes may help elucidate the mechanisms
of protein and oil biosynthesis.

1. Introduction
With an average composition of approximately 40% protein and 20% oil, soybean (Glycine
max (L.) Merr.) is the most important source of vegetable protein and edible oil, accounting for
68% of total global protein consumption [1] and more than half of global oilseed production [2].
Breeders have the goal of producing soybean varieties with high-protein and oil content, traits that are
quantitatively controlled by multiple genes that have small effects and are significantly influenced by
the environment [3-5]. A strong negative correlation between protein and oil content has been verified
in previous studies [6,7], suggesting that some quantitative traitloci (QTL) may inversely affect protein
and oil content. Identifying and studying QTL associated with protein or oil content is important

for directing molecular breeding, and identifying genes and gene functions that affect protein and
oil content.
To find genetic markers that are near genes controlling traits of interest, linkage analysis can
be performed using biparental segregating populations [8]. Since Diers et al. [3] first used linkage
analysis to discover a major QTL connected to soybean protein and oil content on chromosome (Chr.)
20, studies have been conducted to detect QTL near various types of markers, including amplified
fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
markers, and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in biparental populations [7,9-13]. The Soybase
website has listed 255 and 322 QTL linked to protein and oil content, respectively, involving every
chromosome in the biparental population (http-/soybase.org), 8 July 2019). However, the limited
overlap of protein/oil-interelated markers and sparse density of molecular markers used in previous
reports have inhibited the identification of candidate genes within the wide QTL: intervals and limited
the increase in protein or oil contentresulting from marker-assisted selection (MAS) [14]. Requirements
for the construction of secondary mapping populations and the use of map-based cloning have slowed
down application to breeding. Using recently developed high-density single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) markers based on high-throughput sequencing, Seo et al. [2] identified 23 protein and oil QTL
withinsmall regions that covered 14 linkage groups using 1570 SNP markers, including qHPO20, a QTL
significant for both protein and oil content that overlapped a previously reported QTL [13,15-17].
Wang et al. [18] constructed two high-density genetic maps that contained 4000 more SNP markers,
examined loci related to soybean evolutionary traits, and predicted candidate genes that related to
these traits. Patil et al. used a high-resolution bin map (3343 SNP markers) to detect 18 QTL connected
to soybean seed protein, oil, and sucrose content QTL that were then confirmed by a genome-wide
association study (GWAS) [5].
GWAS, based on linkage disequilibrium (LD), is a prevailing strategy to find genetic variations
that affect complex traits by using genome-wide markers combined with phenotypes [8,19].
Hansen et al. [20] first successfully applied GWAS to plant genetics, tightly linking the B gene
to the annual growth habit of sea beet using genome-wide AFLP markers. In recent years, GWAS
has been applied to analyze complex quantitative traits in soybean such as protein, oil, fatty acid,
and amino acid content and salinity tolerance in the different wild, landrace, and elite soybean lines,
yielding putative candidate genes based on bioinformatic analysis in order to identify their action
mechanisms [21-23]. Lee et al. [24] gathered 621 soybean accessions from maturity group I-IV and
34014 SNP markers to identify QTL for protein, oil, and amino acid content. They also detected some
QTL on Chr 5,10, 15, and 20 that coincided with previous results [3,25-27].
Compared with linkage analysis, association analysis does not require the construction of a
mapping population and can analyze multiple alleles from the same locus simultaneously [19]. Due to
abundantrecombination accumulated duringthe long-term imobutinofratumalppltons the results
are of higher resolution that can even be located within individual genes [8,28]. However, population
structure and genetic relationships may lead to false positive results in association analyses [29];
hence, it is best to combine linkage analysis and association analysis for the most accurate QTL
results. Combined analysis methods have successfully mapped loci to associated traits in rice [30,31]
and maize [32,33], but it is rarely employed to study soybean protein and oil content. In this study,
we combine linkage analysis and GWASmethods to detect QTL and identify candidate genes that are
linked to protein and oil content.
2. Results
2.1. Phenotypic Variation ofProtein and Oil Contents in Two Panels
Three hundred and eight recombinant inbred lines (RILS) and 203 soybean accessions were
used in this study. The seed protein and oil content of two panels grown over three years in three
different locations are summarized in Table 1. The protein content in the two parent lines for the RILS,



Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 5915
3of19
Zigongdongdou (ZGDD) and Heihe27 (HH27), averaged over different locations, was 44.55% and
40.81%, respectively, and the average oil content was 18.69% and 20.07%, respectively. Differences in
protein and oil content between the parent lines were significant in Sanya in 2016, 2017, 2018 (16SY,
17SY, 18SY), and Xinxiang in 2018 (18XX) (p < 0.01), but not in Xiangtan in 2017 (17XT). Data for the
parent lines grown in Xinxiang in 2017 (17XX) were not available. The mean content for RILS was
between the parents, with transgressive segregation expanding the range. The skewness and kurtosis
indicate that the data conforms to a normal distribution that is apparent in the histograms in Figure 1,
suggesting that both protein and oil content are controlled by multiple genes that can be analyzed by
linkage analysis. The protein and oil content in the association panel also follow a normal distribution
that is conducive to GWAS and have a wide phenotypic variation for traits as indicated by the variance,
range, and coefficient of variance (CV) observed (Table 1).

Variance analysis (ANOVA) (Table 1) revealed that significant differences (p < 0.01) were found
in genotype, environment, and genotype X environment interactions for the two traits. Broad-sense
heritability (H2) of both traits was high (0.83-0.90), demonstrating that genetic factors play a vital role
in the accumulation of protein and oil in these lines.

2.2. Genetic Map and QTL Analysis ofProtein and Oil Contents
Seven thousand one hundred and twenty-three SNP markers were filtered to construct a genetic
map. Markers with severe segregation distortion (x2 > 100) were removed through Joinmap 4.1.
The final map included 3454 SNP markers covering 20 linkage groups (LGs) that spanned 2208.16 cM
of the genome with an average distance of 0.64cM between adjacent markers. There was an average of
173 SNP markers in each LG, ranging from 70 (on Chr. 11) to 260 (on Chr. 3) [34].
Using the genetic map, we identified QTL that were co-detected by two algorithms: inclusive
composite interval mapping (ICIM) and a mixed model based on composite interval mapping (MCIM)
and/or consistently detected in multiple environments, and combined QTL that exist in two adjacent
intervals as the same QTL. This resulted in the identification of seven protein content QTL and eight
oil content QTL that were located on 11 chromosomes (Table 2 and Figure 2). The limit of detection
(LOD) value (the threshold for ICIM) of these QTL ranged from 2.90 to 35.35 while the F values
(the threshold for MCIM) were from 4.80 to 26.20, and these QTL explained 1.56% to 23.98% of the
phenotypic variation. The QTL with positive values for the additive effect indicates that the ZGDD
parent contributes to the allele that is conducive to the trait. The QTL on Chr. 1, 15, and 20 are linked
to both protein and oil content. Among those QTL, 9Pro15-1/90il15-1 contributed to a high phenotypic
variation explanation (PVE) (13.40%-17.81%), was localized to a narrow physical region (from 2691560
bp to 3476238 bp), and was indictedby both algorithms and three different environments. Therefore,
this QTL interval was further examined to identify candidate genes. A second, oil-related QTL qOil5-1,
was also detected by two algorithms, apparent in every environment, and contributed a large PVE
ranging from 7.04% to 23.98%. 4Prol5-1,4Pro20-1, and q0il5-1 were significant QTL intervals identified
in at least three environments, having high LOD/F value and contributing more than 7% PVE (Table 2
and Supplementary Figure S1).

2.3. Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) Results
Two hundred and three soybean accessions consisting of a diverse range of protein and oil content
were genotyped, yielding 3,977,183 SNPS and 491,910 indels. After filtering for missing rates < 10%,
minor allele frequencies X 5% and LD pruning, 94,462 SNPs and indels were available for GWAS.
Principal component (PC) analysis was conducted with 94,462 SNPS and indels and three outlier
cultivars (Hai 94, Wuhuasiyuehuang, and Suidaohuang) were identified and removed from the
association panel. The first three PCs dominate the population structure (Figure 3a), they divide the
population into two main groups which exhibit a geographic distribution pattern (Figure 3b). The first
subgroup primarily consisted of cultivars from the northeast region of China (NER) and the USA,
while the second subgroup mainly included cultivars from the Huang-Huai region of China (HHR)
and the south region of China (SR). However, a few accessions from NER and USA (e.g., liaodou15 and
Hood) were sorted into the second subgroup and a few accessions from HHR and SR (e.g., qihuang10
and taiwan75) were placed in the first subgroup (Figure 3b,c), perhaps due to their parents' origin area.
Population structure analysis indicated K == 2 was the modeling choice (Figure 3c and Supplementary
Figure S2), and the result was confirmed by the PC analysis. The heat map of the population shows
their kinship that can distribute into two subpopulations (Figure 3d). The physical distance of total LD
decay, where r2 dropped below 0.1, was approximately 132 kb (Figure 3e), and we also detected the LD
decay of accessions from NER, USA, HHR, and SR with the relative LD decay distances of 180, 190,
171, and 161kb, respectively.
To minimize false positives due to population structure, we performed a general linear model
(GLM) and a mixed linear model (MLM) and found that MLM effectively reduced false positive SNPS.
A threshold of -log (P) == 4 was determined as the criteria for detecting significant signals of protein and
oil content. Further, we conducted GWAS on two sub-population panels (the NER-USA and HHR-SR
sub-populations). A total of 19, 12, and 36 SNP loci distributed on 17 chromosomes were detected
in the NER-USA and HHR-SR sub-populations and total population, respectively (Supplementary
Table S1 and Supplementary Figure S3). The p-values of all significant SNP loci were from 9.37 X 10-7
to 9.90 X 10-5. One SNP on Chr. 5, 9, 13, 16, 18, and three SNPS on Chr. 20 (41133383, 35512580, and
34990940) were associated with both traits in one environment, and these significant SNP loci on Chr.
20 were associated with both protein and oil content in 17XX and 18XX.

Four significant SNP loci regions distributed on Chr. 2, 6, 9 and 20 were co-detected, and all
the SNP loci detectedby GWAS were distributed in the QTL intervals obtained by linkage analysis.
The co-detected SNP regions on Chr. 2 and Chr. 6had a weak PVE (<5%), but likely included genes
that exerted modest effects. The region on Chr. 20 was linked to both protein and oil content, with a
higher PVE for protein content (7.24-9.39%).
2.5. Candidate Genes and Expression Levels
We next searched for candidate genes in a co-detected SNP region from Chr. 20 and an extra
strongly indicated QTL interval from Chr. 15. Based on the LD decay distance of total population and
four regions, we extended the regions about 200 kb that from 34.60 to 35.40 Mb including the SNP loci
on Chr. 20. The physical region of gPro15-1/g0il15-1 on Chr. 15 was from 2.60 to 3.50 Mb. We focused
on genes that were indicated by annotation information to be involved in protein or oil metabolism
as candidate genes. Nine and 16 genes were selected on Chr 15 and Chr. 20, respectively, that were
predicted to have one of these four categories of function: structural components, metabolic enzymes,
material transporters, and regulators of gene expression (Table 4).
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was applied to measure the relative expression of the 25
candidate genes, identifying eight genes thuthadsgilfantcdifrencs in the expression levelsl between
the two parent lines at late reproductive growth stages in pods. Glyma.15g033200, Glyma.15g034100,
Glyma.20g105300, Glyma.20g106900, and Glyma.20g107600 shared la pattern oflow expression levels with
no significant difference between the two parents up to 25 days after the R3 period, then the expression
level of these genes in ZGDD increased sharply compared to HH27 (Figure 4a). As shown in Figure 4b,
the expression of Glyma.15g034600 and Glyma.20g103200 was higherin HH27, but generally low in both
parents until 25 days after the R3 period. Then, 30 days after the R3 period, gene expression switched
to be significantly higher in ZGDD only to reverse again by the 35th day to be highly expressed in
HH27 relative to ZGDD. Glyma.15g040100 has its own distinct pattern. For the first 10 days after the
R3 period, both parents had high expression levels, then the expression decreased with expression in
HH27 being significantly higher than in ZGDD (Figure 4c). The detailedexpression patterns for the
other five genes are shown in Supplementary Figure S4.

3. Discussion
3.1. The Accuracy OfQTL Analysis and GWAS is Improved by Using Phenotypic Data from Different Locations
and Employing Ample SNP Markers
The two soybean populations we studied were planted in three different geographical locations.
Previous studies have shown that soybean varieties originating from higher latitudes possess lower
protein content and higher oil content and that the protein content of the same soybean variety is
negatively correlated with latitude, altitude, day length, and the oil content, while being positively
correlated with temperature and moisture [7,35,36]. Song et al. [37] also found that crude protein
content was positively correlated with accumulated temperature N 15 OC and mean daily temperature.
In our study, the protein and oil content of ZGDD/HH27 were different when grown in three different
locations, especially in XT (Table 1); the comprehensive climate factors in XT must have led to the
significant change in protein and oil content of HH27, producing a wide phenotypic variation in the
RILS used for QTL analysis. Growth in multiple environments also expanded the phenotypic variation
of the association panel (Table 1). The use of plants grown over multiple years at different locations
helped us reduce environmental factors to identify genes that tconsistently affect these traits in our QTL
and GWAS analyses.
Increasing the number of markers also improves the accuracy of QTL analysis and GWAS.
The application of AFLP, RFLP, and SSR markers in QTL localization of soybean protein and oil content
has previously been limited, resulting in imprecise QTL region identification [29,38]. In this study,
3454 SNP markers obtained by simplified genome resequencing were used to increase the resolution
of the genetic map (0.64 cM of average distance between adjacent markers) and reduce the physical
interval of the QTL (average distance was about 1.5 Mb). For GWAS, LD decay distance determines
the minimum saturation marker density and using more markers produces a higher probability of
detecting functional sites [19]. Nearly one hundred thousand filtered SNP and indel markers were
used in this study, improving the precision of GWAS to study the complex traits.
3.2. Refined QTL Intervals and SNP Loci for Protein and Oil Content Were Identified
Although multiple protein and oil content QTL have been previously discovered, few have
been effectively used in breeding due to their small phenotypic effects and poor reproducibility,
SO identifying QTL with consistent, large effects is desirable [7,39]. In our linkage analysis study,
QTL that were detected by both ICIM and MCIM algorithms and/or stably detected in multiple growth
environments were identified. All of the QTL intervals overlapped or were close to regions reported
by previous studies (Table 2). Here, we followed up on the QTL located on Chr. 15 and 20 that
were significantly and consistently correlated to both protein and oil content. Diers et al. [3] located
an oil-related QTL near the RFLP marker Pb on Chr. 15, which was close to the physical region of
9Pro15-1/90il15-1 identified in this study and a similar region was further associated with soybean
protein or oil content in other QTL studies [2,12,26]. Some SNP loci correlated to fatty acid and amino
acid phenotypes were also included in this region [15,22], but candidate genes were not discovered.
A second QTL, 9Pro20-1/90il20-1 identified in our study, also overlapped with a previously reported
QTL region. Reinprecht et al. [40] detected a protein and oil QTL adjacent to the marker Satt270
which included a protein content QTL identified by Lu et al. [41Jand an oil content QTL found by
Qi et al. [16]. Using high-density SNP markers obtained by genome resequencing, Patil et al. [5]
also detected a protein content QTL in the physical region from 33.8 to 37.4 Mb on Chr. 20 in two
environments. Our refined QTL will make MASI breeding more accurate and efficient. As to an oil
QTL on Chr. 5, GWAS studies have shown that some SNP loci in this region regulated oil content
and hence they searched for the candidate genes [29,42]. Zhang et al. [22] associated a SNP locus at
Chr. 5: 41883826 bp with oil content, and identified a candidate gene Glyma.05g245000 that annotated
as 30wSamtemast-detydingnec Lee et al. [24] discovered five significant oil-related SNP loci
positioned within 41.75-41.89 Mb on Chr. 5, and they listed some previous QTL for protein and oil



Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 5915
13of19
content that were in the same region identified by our linkage analysis results. This supports the
reliability of our results and suggests that there must be some oil regulating genes in this region.
In the GWAS results, the SNP loci on Chr. 20 interested us because they were embedded in the
QTL intervals that had high PVE. Priolli et al. [43] detected a SNP locus that associated with fatty acid
components near marker Satt270 on Chr. 20 and thatis located in the SNP loci region identified in this
study. However, since other GWAS studies have identified a different region of Chr. 20 from 29 to
34 Mb [5,15,24,29,42], this study has likely discovered a novel region to excavate for candidate genes.
3.3. The Candidate Genes Differentially Expressed at Late Reproductive Growth Stage between Both Parents
Will Be Further Analyzed
Comparing the results identified as QTL intervals and SNP loci, we decided the co-detected SNP
loci region 34.60-35.40 Mb extendedby approximately 200 kb on Chr. 20, and the 4Pro15-1/g0il15-1
interval 2.60-3.50Mb on Chr. 5, an extra region, were the bestnovel regions for candidate genes, rather
novel QTL intervals, that might control protein and/or oil metabolism. The synthesis and catabolism of
protein and oil are complex biochemical processes [44,45] and we looked for the genes that might play
roles in protein and/or oil metabolism based on annotated information.
To test the 25 genes predicted to influence the accumulation of protein and oil content, we looked
for differential relative expression levels during R3 to R8 growth stages in the two parents ZGDD
and HH27,resulting in the identification of eight candidate genes for further study. Previous studies
have shown that the accumulation of protein and oil content is most concentrated during the late
reproductive growth stage and they are negatively correlated at this stage [46,47]. The energy needed
to produce oil in seed mainly comes from saccharides and protein, and some varieties of protein can
be degraded into acetyl-CoA, which is the raw material of oil [46,48]. Protein and oil accumulate in
the developing seeds of pods, but the surrounding pods can transport matter into the seeds, SO we
extracted RNA from the whole pods. Here, we discovered that eight genes had significantly different
expression levels at a late reproductive growth stage between the two parents, ZGDD derived from
low latitude of China that was grown in short-day conditions (12 h light/12 h dark) and HH27 derived
from high latitude of China that was grown in long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark). Among
these eight genes, five genes of Glyma.15g033200 (structural constituent of ribosome), Glyma.15g034100
(acyltransferase activity), Glyma.20g105300 (serine/threonine kinase family protein), Glyma.20g106900
(translation initiation factor 3 (IF-3) family protein), and Glyma.20g107600 (phospholipase-like protein)
had similar expression patterns (Figure 4a), the significantly up-regulatedexpresion of these genes
in ZGDD at the late reproductive growth stage might be the reason for high protein content of
ZGDD. The significantly up-regulated expression of two genes Glyma.15g034600 (drug transmembrane
transport, transport of citric acid, and malic acid) and Glyma.20g103200 (tryptophan, anthranilate
synthase) in HH27 at the late reproductive growth stage (Figure 4b) might contribute to the high oil
content of HH27. Glyma.15g040100 (ACT domain-containing protein, metabolic process like protein
synthesis and degradation), expressed stably but significantly higher in HH27 (Figure 4c), could
also have created the higher oil content in HH27. These results provide preliminary evidence for
the possible roles of these genes played in the accumulation of protein and/or oil content. However,
environmental conditions have a great influence on protein and oil content. Since the parents were
grown with two different photoperiod treatments, a possible role for photoperiod will be addressed
in follow up experiments to determine whether gene expression and accumulation of protein and
oil content are related to photoperiod or the variety itself. Different protein and oil content between
cultivars from diverse regions may be correlated to variations in photoperiods.

4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Plant Materials and Field Trials
The plant material included a linkage panel and an association panel. The linkage panel consisted
of RILS from 308 F2:7 lines derived from a cross between HH27 (protein content is 39%, oil content is
21%) and ZGDD (protein content is 45%, oil content is 19%). RILS and their parents were grown in six
environments: Sanya (SY, 18°23'N, 109°11'E), Hainan province in 2016, 2017, and 2018; Xiangtan (XT,
27-47N,112955E), Hunan province in 2017; and Xinxiang (XX, 35°18'N, 113°55'E), Henan province in
2017 and 2018. The associationpanel, composed of 203 soybean accessions thatincluded 182 accessions
from China (94 from NER, 50 from HHR, 38 from SR) and 21 accessions from the USA (Supplementary
Table S2), was planted in 18SY, 17XT, 17XX, and 18XX. Both panels were grown in a randomized
complete block design with two replications. The arrangement was 1.5 m long rows with 0.5 m row
spacing and 0.1 m of distance between individuals.
4.2. Phenotypic Data and Analysis
Fourier transform-near infrared reflectance (FT-NIR) spectrometry (Bruker, Karlsruhe, German)
was applied to scan the near infrared absorption spectra of the dry seeds. Under the Quant 2 method
of OPUS V. 4.2 software (Bruker, Karlsruhe, German), the samples' protein and oil content data were
calculated using the dry basis model [49]. Each RIL and soybean accession from each replication of
each environment was detected three times using about 150-200 dry seeds per detection, with the
average used in statistical analysis. The histogram of phenotypic data was constructed using EXCEL
(Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Statistical analysis of phenotypic data and ANOVA was conducted
using SAS V. 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), with type III analysis being employed. The H2 of
protein and oil contents was calculated using the following equation [50]:
G*E e + 02/re
in which oE is genetic variance, OGLE is genotype X environment variance, 02 is error variance, r is the
number of replications, and leis the number of environments.
4.3. Genotyping and Linkage Analysis
For RILS, 2b-RAD technology [51] was applied to do simplified genome resequencing. Qualified
libraries were paired-end sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq Xten platform to obtain high-quality SNP
markers widely distributed throughout the genome. UsingJoinmap v. 4.1 [52] to construct the genetic
map, markers beyond the LOD threshold 5.0 were scattered into 20 LGs [34]. A regression algorithm
and the Kosambi function were used to calculate the map distances (in cM) between adjacent markers.
QTL were predicted using two software packages based on different algorithms. IciMapping
V. 4.1 [53] used the ICIM algorithm, with the following default parameters: mapping method was
ICIM-ADD, step was 1 cM, PIN was 0.001, and LOD threshold was manual input of 2.5. QTLNetwork
v. 2.1 [54Jemployed the MCIMalgorithm, with the permutation performed 1000 times, the F-threshold
set to 4.7,and testing window and walk speed set to 10 and 1 cM, respectively.
4.4. Genotyping and GWAS
The 203 soybean cultivars were sequenced with the high-throughput next-generation sequencing
platform of Hi-Seq 2000 with an average sequencing depth of 10-fold and genotyped using the
Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) pipeline [55]. After being trimmedby TRIMMOMATIC (parameter:
illuminaclip: adaptor. seq: 2:30:10 trailing: 3 sliding window: 4:10 MINLEN: 20), clean reads were
mapped to the soybean reference genome (v. Wm82.a2.v1) by BWA [56] with default parameters,
SNPs/InDels were called by GATK (-stand_call_conf set to 30.0, -stand_emit_conf set to 10.0, and -glm
set to BOTH). The variations were then recalibrated by a Gaussian mixture model, and outliers were



Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 5915
15of19
discarded. Variants were furtherfilteredby BCFtools(v. 1.2,QUAL X 50.0,DP N 5.0,QD X 5.0, MQ N 30,
MAF N 0.03, Coverage X 90%). InDels longer than 6 bp were discarded. More than four million SNPs
and indels were obtained. SNPS and indels were filtered with missing rates < 10% and minor allele
frequencies X 5% using PLINK [57]. The sequencing data of 125 accessions used in this study have
been deposited into the NCBI database under Short Read Archive (SRA) accession number SRP062560,
and the sequencing data of the rest 78 accessions used only in this study have been deposited into SRA
database in NCBI under accessionnumber PRJNA589345. Linkage disequilibrium value was calculated
using the LD composite method in SNPRelate software and highly-linked SNPs were pruned, and
LD plots were modified via locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) using R software and
testing smoothing parameters fixed to 0.01 [58]. PCA was conducted by SNPRelate, and 3 cultivars
of population bias were removed based on the PCA result. The software fastSTRUCTURE was used
to analyze the population structure (K = 2, 3,4, 5) [59] and it was verified based on the PCA result.
Association signals of seed protein and oil were identified based on 94,462 SNPs and indels from
200 samples with MLM by the first three PCs and kinship in GAPIT [60]. The LD analysis was
calculated by using the squared allele frequency correlation (r2) in PopLDdecay [61]. The critical
threshold was set as p < 10-4 to declare the significant SNP loci in GWAS.
4.5. Identification and Verification ofCandidate Genes
Based on the LDdecay distance, 200 kb upstream and downstream of regions near the significant
SNP loci on Chr. 20 were explored to identify genes whose functional annotation related to the
metabolism of protein and/or oilin the soybeanreference genome Williams 82 (htpJ/wwwsoybaseorg),
The functional annotation was from TAIR (www.arabidopsisorg), GO (htplgencontologyorg),
PFAM (htpl/pfam.xfam.org), PANTHERhtp/www.pantherdb.org) databases and KOG (clusters
of orthologous groups for eukaryotic complete genomes) annotation. Similarly, the QTL interval on
Chr. 15 were also scanned to identify candidate genes. qRT-PCR was applied to identify the relative
expression of candidate genes in the pods of two parents: ZGDD planted in a short-day greenhouse
(12hlight/121 h dark) and HH27 planted in a long-day greenhouse (16 h light/8 h dark) to simulate their
suitable light conditions in order to get protein and oil content close to that in the originate region (the
parent ZGDD originates from low latitude area of China (Zigong, Sichuan province, 29°20'N, 104°46'E),
it is sensitive to photoperiods and can only blossom and mature in a short-day condition; the parent
HH27 derives from high latitude area of China (Heihe, Heilongjiang province, 50°14'N, 127031'E),itis
insensitive to photoperiods and can blossom and mature in both long-day and short-day conditions.).
Pods were picked from the middle nodes of the main stem every five days from the R3 through the
R8 stage, with three replicates for each plant [62]. The entire pods were used for the isolation of total
RNA using TransZol Up (Transegen Biotech, Beijing, China). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from
1 ug of the total RNA using a FastQuant RT Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). For qRT-PCR, 10 uL
reaction volume was applied using KAPASYBRO FAST qPCR Kits (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington,
MA, USA) with the following components: 1 UL of 1:5 diluted cDNA, 0.2 UL of each primer (10 JM),
5 UL of 2 X SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix, 0.2 UL of 50 X ROX Low Reference Dye, and water to a
final volume of 10 UL. QuantStudio 7 Flex (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to run
the qRT-PCR with following conditions: hold stage was 95 °C for 3 min; PCR stage was 40 cycles of
95 C for 5s and 60 OC for 30 s; melt curve stage was 95 C for 15s, 60 OC for1i min and 95 C for 15s.
All PCR reactions were run in triplicate. Data were analyzed using the 2-AACE method with the mRNA
level of the GmActin (Glyma.18g290800) gene used as the internal control. The primers used are shown
in Supplementary Table S3.
5. Conclusions
In summary, using linkage analysis and GWAS, we detected 15 reproducible and significant QTL
intervals and 67 significant SNP loci that affect the protein and/or oil content of soybeans. We searched
the co-detected SNP region on Chr. 20 and an extra QTL interval on Chr. 15 to identify 25 candidate

genes that may regulate the accumulation of soybean protein and oil. Among them, eight genes had
differential expression patterns in the parent lines (ZGDD and HH27) at late reproductive growth
stages. Further experiments with these gene candidates should lead to a better understanding of the
molecular mechanisms of protein and oil biosynthesis in soybean. The refined QTL intervals and SNP
loci in our study could also improve molecular breeding based on these markers.
