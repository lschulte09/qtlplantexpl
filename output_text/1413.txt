45 unique SNPS thattagged 144 loci were associated with canopywilting in atleast one environment with one

accessions were identified with canopy wilting superior to those of check genotypes. The germplasm and
genomic regions identified can be used to better understand the slow canopy wilting trait and be
incorporated into elite germplasm to improve drought tolerance in soybean.
