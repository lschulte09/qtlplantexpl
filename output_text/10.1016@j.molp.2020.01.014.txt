SHORT SUMMARY
Natural variation in flowering time is critical for geographic adaption of soybean. A circadian
clock gene GmPRR3b was identified as a major flowering time QTL through genome-wide
association study (GWAS). Its haplotype H6 associated with early flowering and vigorous
growth traits has been extensively utilized during domestication and breeding of modern
cultivars.
ABSTRACT
Improved soybean cultivars have been adapted to grow at a wide range of latitudes, enabling
expansion of cultivation worldwide. However, the genetic basis for this broad adaptation is
still not clear. Here we report the identification of GmPRR3b as a major flowering time
regulatory gene that has been selected during domestication and genetic improvement for
geographic expansion. Through genome-wide association study (GWAS) of a diverse
landrace panel of soybean (comprised of 279 accessions), we identified 16 candidate
quantitative loci associated with flowering time and maturity time. The strongest signal
resides on the known flowering gene E2, verify the effectiveness of our approach. We
detected strong association signals of a genomic region containing GmPRR3b with both
flowering and maturity time. Haplotype analysis revealed that GmPRR3LH6 is the major form
that has been utilized during recent breeding of modern cultivars. mRNA profiling analysis
showed that GmPRR36H6 displays a rhythmic and photoperiod-dependent expression that is
preferentially induced under long day conditions. Overexpression of GmPRR36H6 conferred
increased main stem node number and high yield phenotypes, while knockout of GmPRR3LH6
by CRISPR-Cas9 technology retarded growth and delayed floral transition. GmPRR3bH6

appears to act as a transcriptional repressor of multiple predicted circadian clock genes,
including GmCCAla which directly upregulates J/GmELF3a to modulate flowering time.
Taken together, the causal SNP (Chr12:5520945) likely endows GmPRR3bH6 ai moderate but
appropriate activity, which is associated with early flowering and vigorous growth traits
preferentially selected for broad adaption in landraces and improved cultivars.

INTRODUCTION
Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is a legume crop providing plant oil and protein for humans
and livestock. Archaeological and evolutionary studies have shown that soybean was
domesticated from its progenitor (Glycine soja Sieb. & Zucc.) approximately 5,000 years ago
in East Asia (Lee et al., 2011). A suite of domestication-related traits, including flowering
time, were selected in traditional landraces and the breeding of improved cultivars (Wang et
al., 2018a). Wild soybean is a typical short-day plant that flowers early when the day length is
shorter than a certain threshold. Day length-insensitive flowering has been an essential trait
for the cultivation of soybean and its geographical spread to lower and/or higher latitudes
(Sedivy et al., 2017).
Previous population genetics analyses identified a number of genes as putative targets of
selection for changes in flowering time during domestication, including at least ten flowering
loci, designated El to E9 and J (Lam et al., 2010; Li et al., 2019c; Li et al., 2014; Possart et
al., 2014; Wu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017). Among them, El encodes a legume-specific
flowering repressor which inhibits flowering under long day conditions; E2 encodes a
homolog of Arabidopsis GIGANTEA (GI); both E3 and E4 encode homologs of
PHYTOCHROME A (PhyA); E9 encodes a homolog of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT); and J
encodes a homolog of EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3), a key component of the evening
complex (Cober et al., 2010; Gould et al., 2013; Kong et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2017). However,
genetic differentiation analyses of these genes between G. soja and landraces suggest that
only E2 was associated with domestication (Wang et al., 2016). The causal alleles of the other
genes likely occurred after the separation of G. max and G. soja and enabled local adaptation
to new climatic regions, e.g. El and E4 for higher-latitude regions (Jiang et al., 2014;
Tsubokura et al., 2013), and J and E9 (GmFT2a) for lower-latitude tropical regions (Lu et al.,
2017; Zhao et al., 2016).
Plants rely on an endogenous circadian clock system to coordinate their growth,
development, defense, and metabolism to daily and seasonal environmental changes. Previous
studies in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana showed that the circadian clock is a
self-sustaining timekeeping mechanism consisting of multiple interlocking feedback loops
2



Journal Pre-proof
(Hsu and Harmer, 2014). The morning loop comprises morning-expressed CIRCADIAN
CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCAI), LATE ELONGATION HYPOCOTYL (LHY),
PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATOR 9 (PRR9) and PRR7. The evening loop comprises
evening-expressed TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOCIY/PRRI, EARLY FLOWERING 3
(ELF3), ELF4 and LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX). These two loops are connected by the central
oscillator loop consisting of CCA1, LHY, and TOCI (Sanchez and Kay, 2016). Most of these
components in Arabidopsis are transcriptional repressors, underlying a 'repressilator' model
for the oscillating machine (McClung, 2019).
PRRs (designated as APRRs in Arabidopsis and including APRR9, APRR7, APRR5,
APRR3, and APRRI/TOCI) are key components of the plant circadian clock. PRRs belong to
a protein family containing a pseudo receiver (PR) domain at the N-terminal and a CCT
domain (named after the presence in CONSTANS (CO), CO-like and TOC1) at the
C-terminal. The PR domain is essential for protein-protein interactions. Most PRR proteins
contain an EAR-like motif that recruits TOPLESS (TPL) and histone deacetylases to repress
target gene expression by epigenetic modifications (Wang et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2018).
PRRs regulate many physiological processes in plants. Arabidopsis mutants in the PRR gene
family show a wide range of defects in the circadian clock, photoperiodic flowering, growth,
and stress responses (Hayama et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019a). In parallel to the model plant
Arabidopsis thaliana, numerous studies have identified distinct natural variation in PRR
homologs in various crops that were selected for adaptation to different regions of cultivation
(Klein et al., 2015; Koo et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015; Murphy et al., 2011). Here, we report
GmPRR3b as an essential flowering quantitative trait locus (QTL), which has been selected
during soybean domestication and facilitated the widespread adaptation of soybean.
RESULTS
Identification of flowering time QTLs by GWAS in soybean landraces
In our previous GWAS and genome-scan study using 1,938 Chinese soybean landraces, we
found that two flowering time-associated variants on chromosome 12, Chr12:5470311 and
Chr12:5914898, exhibit strong selection signatures during domestication (Li et al., 2019e).
The genomic regions covering these two domestication variants are still very large (92.9 kb
and 73.5 kb, respectively), due to the limited density of SNPs inferred from the tGBSO
approach (Ott et al., 2017). To identify new regulatory genes of flowering time in soybean, we
selected a genetically representative panel of 279 diverse accessions from 1,938 landraces
(Supplemental Table 1) for whole-genome re-sequencing analysis (with an average depth of
6.03x per genome and covering 95.3% of the soybean reference genome Glycine max
Wm82.a2.vl (https:/phytozome.jgi.doe.gov). These landraces were collected from sites
3



Journal Pre-proof
across China, ranging from 19.4to 51.4 ON latitude, 85.6 to 132.1 E longitude. We obtained a
total of 1,770 Gb of clean sequence. In addition, we downloaded re-sequencing data for 106
soybean accessions (58 G. soja accessions and 48 improved cultivars) from the NCBI Short
Read Archive (accession number: SRA045129) published previously (Zhou et al., 2015b).
After calibrating SNP calling quality using all 385 genomes and discarding SNPs with
missing rates > 0.4 and a minor allele frequency < 0.01, a dataset of 8,624,466 high-quality
SNPs was recovered. Among these, 73.5% (6,341,742 SNPS) were observed for soybean
landraces.
Using these 6,341,742 SNPS and phenotype data collected in Beijing (40.1 ON) and
Wuhan (30.5 ON) for 279 soybean landraces, GWAS analyses were performed for flowering
time and maturity time using Compressed Mixed Linear Model (CMLM). We detected 16
candidate QTL regions for flowering time (using 7 N 0.8) with association signals exceeding
a significant threshold (-logio P N 7) in both test sites (Beijing and Wuhan) (Supplemental
Figure 1 and Supplemental Table 2). Notably, the strongest association was represented by the
peak SNP Chr10:45310798, which is known to be the causal variant of flowering gene E2
(Wang et al., 2016). Both the second strongest signal (Chr12:5483364) in Beijing and the top
signal in Wuhan (Chr12:5520945) for flowering time are located on Chromosome 12 (Figure
1A and Supplemental Figure 1). GWAS analyses for maturity time in the Wuhan site also
identified a strong signal (Chr12:5520945) on chromosome 12 (P = 3.9E - 09) (Figure 1B and
Supplemental Figure 2). These results are consistent with our earlier report that the region
between Chr12:5470311 and Chr12:5914898 on chromosome 12 contains important
flowering time regulatory gene (Li et al., 2019e) and further narrow down the region to a
likely region between Chr12:5483364 and Chr12:5520945.
Linkage disequilibrium block structure analysis indicated that Chr12:5483364 and
Chr12:5520945 belongedto the same genetic locus (P N 0.8) and covered a 59.4-kb candidate
genomic region (from 5,483,364 bp to 5,542,737 bp) (Supplemental Table 2). This region
contains three annotated genes, Glyma.12G073800, Glyma.12G073900 and Glyma.12G07400.
Of these, Glyma.12G073900 is an ortholog of Arabidopsis PSEUDO-RESPONSE
REGULATORS3 (AtPRR3) and thus referred to as GmPRR3b (Li et al., 2019b; Para et al.,
2007). Further analysis of the linkage disequilibrium block surrounding Chr12:5520945 using
HAPLOVIEW (Barrett et al., 2005) narrowed 59.4-kb down to a 24.3-kb genomic region
(5,505,719 bp to 5,530,042 bp) (Figure 1C) containing one annotated gene, GmPRR3b. We
observed no variants resulting in amino acid changes in Glyma.12G073800, and one
non-synonymous SNP in Glyma.12G07400 which exhibited no significant association with
flowering time. These observations indicated that GmPRR3b was the most likely causal gene
for flowering time.
The association signal Chr12:5520945 was located in the stop codon of GmPRR3b in the
4



Journal Pre-proof
Williams 82 reference genome. Flowering and maturity time, when stratified by genotypes at
Chr12:5520945 (T/C) exhibited a significant difference among soybean landraces
(Supplemental Figure 3). The average flowering time of landraces carrying the
Chr12:5520945_TT genotype was significantly earlier (P < 0.01) than that of landraces
carrying the alternate genotype by 12.3 days in the Beijing field test site and 6.5 days in the
Wuhan test site (Supplemental Figure 3). These observations reaffirmed that Chr12:5520945
as a causal variant for the observed flowering time change.
GmPRR3b haplotype 6 was selected during domestication and utilized by modern
breeders
To understand the evolutionary process for GmPRR3b during domestication, we investigated
the selection signal in the genomic region harboring GmPRR3b based on pairwise analyses of
Fsrand the ratio of nucleotide diversity (02) between three evolutionary populations: 58 wild
accessions, 279 landraces; and 48 improved cultivars (Supplemental Figure 4). The results
from FST and the ratio of @,demonstrated that GmPRR3b is located in a selective sweep region
showing evidence of selection during both soybean domestication and subsequent genetic
improvement.
Six variants which resulted in amino acids changed were detected in the coding region of
GmPRR3b across our panel of 385 soybean accessions, including four non-synonymous
variants and two variants (Chr12:5509061 and Chr12:5520945) which caused stop-codon
changes and subsequently resulted in the elongation or truncation of the peptide (Figure 1D
and 1E). Thus, a total of eight GmPRR3b haplotypes (hereafter referred to as H1 to H8) were
detected (Figure 1D). H1 carrying Chr12:5509061 and H6 carrying Chr12:5520945 encoded
two truncations of the peptide, compared to other haplotypes (Figure 1E). H6 exhibited the
highest frequency (63.4%), followed by H4 (12.2%). Whereas H1-H3 occurred at relatively
lower frequencies, ranging from 1% to 1.3% (Figure 2A), which were distinguished from the
other haplotypes by Chr12:5509061, Chr12:5519426, and Chr12:5520716 alleles in that they
were specific to the G. soja population. The no. of haplotypes decreased from eight in G. soja
to five in landraces then to one in improved cultivars (Figure 2A), suggesting that GmPRR3b
was strongly selected by human during domestication and genetic improvement.
To evaluate the phenotypic effects of the different haplotypes, we analyzed differences in
flowering time and maturity time in landraces planted in two test sites, Beijing and Wuhan.
The landraces carrying H6-H8 exhibited significantly earlier flowering and maturity in
Wuhan and significantly earlier flowering in Beijing than landraces carrying H4 and H5
(Figure 1F and Supplemental Figure 5). Two single nucleotide substitutions, one of which led
to a single amino acid change (Chr12:5509317) and the other (Chr12:5520945) to a 99 amino
acids change, distinguished early flowering H6-H8 from late flowering H4 and H5 (Figure 1F
5



Journal Pre-proof
and Supplemental Figure 5). This indicates that both Chr12:5509317 and Chr12:5520945 are
likely causal genetic variants and that changes from late flowering to early flowering are
associated with the independent polymorphisms, Chr12:5509317 and Chr12:5520945. The
observations that the frequencies of H6, H7 and H8 were largely increased from 3.4%, 1.7%
and 1.7% in G. soja to 69.4%, 7.5% and 10.8% in landraces respectively (Figure 2A),
signified that early flowering alleles in these two causal genetic variants (Chr12:5509317, and
Chr12:5520945 for) were derived from standing variations in the wild progenitor G. soja.
Median-joining network analysis indicates that H6/H7 and H8 are closely related to H4 and
H5, respectively (Figure 2B).
The geographical distribution of the GmPRR3b haplotypes was surveyed in the 383
soybean accessions collected from East Asia, the native area of soybean (Figure 2C).
Interestingly, 13 of 14 G. soja accessions carrying H1, H2, or H3 were collected from high
latitude areas in northeast China and Russia. The G. soja accessions carrying H4 and H5 were
collected all over East Asia, whereas the landraces carrying H4 and H5 were mainly from
south China, suggesting these two late-flowering haplotypes were selected in south China for
longer maturity which confers higher yields in the short-day conditions (Figure 2C). Only
four G. soja accessions carried H6, H7 or H8, one from Japan (PI366121), two from South
Korea (PI407246 and PI407275) and one from China (PI549046). After domestication, the G.
max accessions carrying H6 were distributed all over China from low to high latitudes,
whereas those carrying H7 and H8 were mainly distributed in central China. Only H6 was
utilized by modern breeders during soybean genetic improvement; all 48 improved cultivars
studied here carried only H6 (Figure 2A). Therefore, we focused on the functional mechanism
of the GmPRR3b haplotype 6 (hereafter referred to as GmPRR3bH6).
Transcript profiles and subcellular localization of GmPRR3bH6
To interrogate the function and underlying molecular mechanism of GmPRR3bH6 in flowering
time regulation, we performed quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to check the transcript
profiles of GmPRR36H6 in cultivar Williams 82. The results showed that its mRNA was highly
expressed in unifoliolate and trifoliate leaves, which are the tissues important for the
perception of ambient light signals including photoperiod (Figure 3A). In addition,
GmPRR3LH6 mRNA exhibited a rhythmic expression pattern peaking at the middle of the day
under diurnal and consequent free-running conditions, implying GmPRR3b is associated with
circadian clock regulation (Figure 3B). Its overall expression level was markedly induced
under long day conditions as compared to short day photoperiods, reminiscent of El, which
acts as the key flowering repressor in soybean (Lu et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2012).
Next, we analyzed the subcellular localization of GmPRR3b. The SNP Chr12:5520945
results in a premature termination codon (CAA to TAA) in GmPRR36H6 which leads to a
6



Journal Pre-proof
truncated protein absent the C-terminal CCT domain, in comparison to GmPRR36H4 (Figure
3C). Two putative nuclear localization signals (NLS1 and NLS2) were identified in the
full-length GmPRR3b protein by the LOCALIZER program (Sperschneider et al., 2017).
NLS2 is located in the CCT domain, suggesting that the CCT domain may be required for the
nuclear localization of GmPRR3b. To test this possibility, we made H4-YFP and H6-YFP
(GmPRR3bH4 and GmPRR3bH6 fused with the yellow fluorescent protein, respectively)
constructs and transformed them into soybean mesophyll protoplasts (Figure 3D). Confocal
microscopy showed that nearly 95% of the protoplasts that expressing H4-YFP and 75% of
protoplasts that expressing H6-YFP had fluorescent signals restricted to the nucleus (Figure
3E), demonstrating that absence of the CCT domain reduces but does not abolish the nuclear
localization of GmPRR3bH6 To further test if NLS1 is required for the nuclear localization,
we made an H6"-YFP construct by site-direct mutation of NLS1 (LGEV to PADF) (Figure
3C). Mutation of NLS1 led to a proportion of protoplasts with nuclear fluorescent signals
decreased to less than 20% (Figure 3E), suggesting that NLS1 and NLS2 are functionally
additive for the nuclear localization of GmPRR3b, and the absence of NLS2 in GmPRR3bH6
mayreduce but not abolish its biological activity.
Overexpression of GmPRR3bH6 dampens the circadian clock
To address whether GmPRR3b H6 is biologically functionable, we made the 35S::YFP-H6 and
35S::H6-YFP overexpression constructs and obtained multiple transgenic lines which were
verified by immunoblotting probed with the anti-GFP antibody (Supplemental Figure 6A and
B, two representative lines were shown). Phenotypic analysis showed that both the YFP-H6
and H6-YFP lines flowered significantly later than wild-type (WT, cultivar Tianlong 1
harboring GmPRR3bH6) plants under natural conditions (ND, summer in Beijing), as well as
under long day (LD) and short day (SD) conditions in growth chambers (Supplemental Figure
6C), suggesting that overexpression of GmPRR3bH6 may delay flowering via a
photoperiod-independent pathway. In addition, the transgenic lines grown in the field were
different from the WT controls in several aspects including elongated flowering period,
increased node and grain number, and enhanced grain yield per plant (Supplemental Figure 7),
again indicating why there may have been preferential selection of GmPRR3LH6 during the
breeding of elite cultivars. As the YFP-H6 and H6-YFP overexpression lines showed similar
phenotypes, only the YFP-H6 line was used in subsequent experiments.
To gain insights into how overexpression of GmPRR3bH6 conferred the later flowering
phenotype, we performed a time-course expression analysis of several well-documented
flowering or circadian clock-associated genes in soybean under LD conditions following a
free-running regimen of continuous light. The qRT-PCR results indicated that the
transcriptional levels of GmFT2a and GmFT5a, both encoding florigens in soybean (Nan et
7



Journal Pre-proof
al., 2014), were decreased in the YFP-H6 line as compared with the WT. Consistent with this,
the mRNA level of El, a key repressor of flowering in soybean (Jiang et al., 2014), was
upregulated in the YFP-H6 line (Supplemental Figure 8). Interestingly, the mRNA levels of
multiple circadian clock genes including GmCCAIS, GmPRR3a, GmPRR5a, GmELF3s,
GmELF4a, GmLUX1 and GmLUX2 decreased to varying degrees in the YFP-H6 line (Figure
4A and B; Supplemental Figure 9-11), suggesting that GmPRR3bH6 may act as a general
transcriptional repressor in the central circadian oscillator machine. Consistent with this
notion, overexpression of YFP-H6 dramatically dampened the rhythmic expression amplitude
of GmCABI(Figure 4C), which serves as an output marker of the plant circadian clock,
reinforcing the notion that GmPRR3bH6 is a key component of the circadian oscillator and
exerts pleiotropic effects on agronomic traits in soybean.
GmPRR3bH6 is a transcriptional repressor of GmCCAla
Given that GmCCAla transcription was downregulated in the YFP-H6 line, together with the
fact that GmPRR3bH6 contains an EAR motif, we suspected that GmPRR3bH6 acts as a direct
repressor of GmCCAla. To test this hypothesis, we checked the DNA sequence of GmCCAla
and found several G-box, TBS and TGTG elements located in its promoter region (Gendron
et al., 2012) (Figure 4D). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were
performed using the YFP-H6 line and GFP-trap beads. The result showed that GmPRR3bH6
robustly bound to the 1, 2 and 3 sites which contain the G-box, TBS and TGTG elements,
respectively, supporting that GmCCAla is a direct target gene negatively regulated by
GmPRR3bH6 (Figure 4E).
GmCCAla directly promotes the transcription of J/ELF3a
Studies in Arabidopsis previously showed that CCA1 negatively regulates the transcription of
evening complex genes including ELF3, ELF4 and LUX (Lu et al., 2012; Nagel et al., 2015).
However, we found that both GmCCAla and J/GmELF3a were downregulated in the YFP-H6
line as compared with WT (Figure 4A and 4B), suggesting that GmCCAla might positively
regulate the transcription of J/GmELF3a in soybean. To test this possibility, we established a
Root Induced Callus Expression (RICE) system to analyze the effect of GmCCAla on the
transcription of J/GmELF3a. Briefly, gene expression construct harbored in Agrobacterium
tumefaciens was transformed into the soybean hair roots, which were further induced to
generate uniform callus through tissue culture. Thus, the regulating network can be
investigated by analyzing the transcript profiles of putative downstream genes in the
transformed callus cultivated under specific regimens.
To test the feasibility of the RICE system, we first checked the rhythmic expression of
GmPRR3b and GmCCAla genes in WT callus using qRT-PCR. Both genes displayed
comparable rhythmic expression patterns in callus (Figure 5A and 5B) and in trifoliate leaves
8



Journal Pre-proof
(Figure 3B and 4B). Then we transformed the H6-YFP construct into the soybean hairy root
and generated H6-YFP overexpression callus. Transcriptional assays demonstrated that the
expression of GmCCAla was significantly downregulated in the H6-YFP overexpression
callus as compared with that in WT callus (Figure 5B). Hence, similar results of H6-YFP
repressing GmCCAla transcription in both callus and trifoliate leaves validated the feasibility
of RICE system.
We then generated the GmCCAla-YFP overexpression callus (Figure 5C) and confirmed
that the GmCCAla indeed could upregulate the transcription levels of J/GmELF3a as well as
other putative evening complex genes in the RICE system (Figure 5D and Supplemental
Figure 12). To further test if GmCCAla directly regulates J/GmELF3a expression, we
performed ChIP experiments using the GmCCAla-YFP overexpression callus and GFP-trap
beads. The result detected robust binding signals of GmCCAla-YFPto the promoter region of
J and other evening complex genes (Figure 5E and 5F; Supplemental Figure 13). Furthermore,
we examined whether GmCCAla might act as a transcriptional activator of J using a
dual-luciferase assay in mesophyll protoplasts according to a previously reported procedure
(Zhang et al., 2014). Briefly, the potential transcriptional activity of GmCCAla was tested by
its effect on the firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter gene driven by the promoter of J/GmELF3a,
using the Renilla reniformis luciferase (REN) driven by the standard 35S promoter as the
internal control (Figure 5G). The result showed that GmCCAla-YFP protein significantly
increased the expression of the reporter gene as compared with the YFP control protein
(Figure 5H), supporting the inference that GmCCAla acts as a transcriptional activator of
J/GmELF3a in soybean. Taken together, these results indicate that overexpression of
GmPRR3LH6 may cause late flowering phenotypes by repressing GmCCAla and then
J/GmELF3a to upregulate the expression of flowering repressor El.
GmPRR3bH6 has a moderate activity to repress GmCCAla expression in comparison to
GmPRR3bH4
Median-joining network analysis showed that GmPRR3b haplotype H6 is most likely derived
from H4 (Figure 2B). To get an insight into how H6 is functionally different from H4, we
tested the transcriptional levels of GmPRR3b in soybean accessions harboring H4 or H6 under
both LD and SD conditions. Twenty accessions of H6 and ten accessions of H4 were selected
for qRT-PCR analysis (Supplemental Table 4). The results showed that the expression levels
of GmPRR3b tended to be lower in the H6 accessions than in the H4 accessions at three time
points under both LD (ZT4, 8 and 12) and SD (ZTO, 4 and 8) conditions (Figure 6A and 6B
and Supplemental Figure 14). In sharp contrast, the expression levels of GmCCAla in the
majority H6 accessions were higher than those in the H4 accessions. These observations are
consistent with our previous observation that GmPRR3b and GmCCAla reciprocally repress
9



Journal Pre-proof
the transcription of each other (Figure 4B and 5A).
To test if the causal SNP (Chr12:5520945) in the H6 accessions affects the GmPRR3b
activity, we ectopically expressed GmPRR3bH4 and GmPRR36H6 in Arabidopsis. The results
showed that GmPRR36H4 was more effective than GmPRR36H6 to promote hypocotyl
elongation and repress flowering in Arabidopsis (Supplemental Figure 15 and 16). Then we
further compared their activity using the RICE system in soybean. We generated dozens of
independent transgenic callus lines expressing comparable levels of YFP-H4 or YFP-H6
(Figure 6C, left panel). The results showed that the expression levels of GmCCAla were more
effectively repressed in the YFP-H4 callus than in the YFP-H6 callus at all three time points
(ZT4, 8 and 12) (Figure 6C, right panel). Correlation analysis between GmPRR3b and
GmCCAla mRNA levels further consolidates that GmPRR3bH6 is less effective than
GmPRR3bH4 in repressing GmCCAla transcription (Figure 6D). Taken together, GmPRR3bH6
harbors a moderate activity in comparison to GmPRR3bH4 , which may be associated with
favorite traits for domestication and breeding improvement.
Knockout of GmPRR36H6 retards growth and delayed floral transition in soybean
To further characterize the function of GmPRR3bH6 in soybean cultivar Tianlong 1, we
generated the Gmprr3b loss-of-function mutants using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology (Figure
7A). DNA sequencing identified two putative null mutants, Gmprr3b-1 and Gmprr3b-2,
which harbor a 4-bp deletion and a 5-bp deletion with a 1-bp substitution, respectively, in the
first exon of GmPRR36H6 y causing frameshifts and pre-termination of protein translation
(Figure 7A). Morphological analysis showed that the Gmprr3b mutants and the GmPRR3bH6
overexpression lines displayed opposite phenotypes in several aspects including plant height,
node and grain number, and yield per plant (Figure 7B and 7C). The Gmprr3b null mutants
produced less main stem nodes and grains in the mature stage, suggesting that GmPRR3bH6 is
essential for vigorous growth and high yield in soybean.
Unexpectedly, the Gmprr3b mutant plants displayed a slightly later flowering phenotype
under ND and LD conditions (Figure 7D). To interrogate why the absence of GmPRR3bH6
delays flowering, we tested the transcription profiles of flowering-associated genes under
both LD and SD conditions (Supplemental Figure 17 and 18). The results showed that the
expression levels of GmCCAla, J and GmFT2a (flowering activators) were upregulated,
while El (flowering repressor) was down-regulated in the Gmprr3b-1 mutant in comparison
to WT (Figure 7E and Supplemental Figure 17 and 18), demonstrating that the abnormal
flowering time of the Gmprr3b mutants is not mediated by the J-E1-GmFT2a pathway
(Figure 7G) (Lu et al., 2017). Alternatively, the delayed flowering of the Gmprr3b mutants
may be a consequence of retarded growth since that the main stem nodes of mutants emerged
significantly slower than the wild type, especially under LD conditions (Figure 7F and
10

Supplemental Figure 19).
DISCUSSION
GmPRR3b is a domestication associated gene selected for early flowering Domestication is
a process involving human selection for morphological and physiological traits that allowed
for cultivation (Gaut et al., 2018). Selection is usually accompanied by loss of allelic diversity
during domestication and genetic improvement (Zhou et al., 2015b). In soybean, a reduction
of 16.2-25% of genetic diversity was detected from the landraces to improved cultivars by
whole genome resequencing (Li et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2015b); thus, early farmer-derived
landraces have a reservoir of genetic diversity. In view of this, landraces have been used to
explore the genetics of domestication of agronomic traits in many species (Navarro et al.,
2017). Flowering time is one of few rare traits, that was expansively selected for during
domestication, geographical expansion and genetic improvement, and obvious differences are
observed between domesticated crops and their progenitors, among crops from different
geographic regions or even among genotypes from similar geographic areas in the case of
soybean (Li et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2017).
In this study, a set of soybean landraces from the general predicted domestication area in
China was used to identify QTL underlying flowering time using a GWAS approach. We
detected one QTL that mapped to a cloned flowering time gene E2 (Fang et al., 2017; Mao et
al., 2017), and a location-stable flowering gene GmPRR3b. Both genes, E2 and GmPRR3b,
showed evidence of selection during domestication (Wang et al., 2016). Whilst under
selection during domestication and subsequent genetic improvement, the frequency of the
early flowering allele in two causal variants (Chr12:5509317 and Chr12:5520945) at
GmPRR3b were increased and likely fixed in improved cultivars. Therefore, we were unable
to detect GmPRR3b in populations that consisted of only improved cultivars, even when a few
landraces were included (Fang et al., 2017; Mao et al., 2017), as they were filtered out in
GWAS analysis due to low frequency. Therefore, focusing on landrace populations allowed us
to identify new genetic variants or genes controlling agronomic traits.
We found eight haplotypes encompassing this gene in our population consisting of wild
soybean (G. soja), landraces and improved cultivars. Of the haplotypes, H1 to H3 are found in
only G. soja, H4 to H8 are in both G. soja and landraces. H6, H7 and H8 are phylogenetically
associated with H4 and H5, respectively (Figure 2B). Accessions carrying H6, H7 and H8 are
geographic distributed in a higher latitude than the ones harboring H4 and H5 (Figure 2C),
consistent with the observation that H6, H7 and H8 are associated with early flowering and
maturation traits as compared with H4 and H5, suggesting that GmPRR3b is not only the
target of artificial selection during domestication and genetic improvement, but also
associated with soybean expansion.

Journal Pre-proof
GmPRR36H6 may have a pleiotropic role favorited for domestication and genetic
improvement Intriguingly, although H6 was also associated with early flowering and
maturation, only the landraces possessing H6, but not H7 or H8, were expanded throughout
China. Moreover, H6 was exclusively selected in the improved cultivars (Figure 2A),
suggesting that H6 might have other 'benefits' for domestication and genetic improvement.
Congruent with this, the overexpression and knockout of GmPRR36H6 displayed multiple
opposite phenotypes in plant height, main stem node number, grain number, and grain yield
per plant (Figure 7), demonstrating a pleiotropic role of GmPRR3b in regulating growth and
development. In addition, knockout of GmPRR3bH6 in cultivar Tianlongl delayed flowering
and retarded growth under LD conditions (Figure 7D and F; Supplemental Figure 19),
implying a possibility that H6 has advantages over other haplotypes in simultaneously
accelerating flowering and ensuring high yield.
Possible modes of GmPRR3bH6 action Recent studies examining the genetics of flowering
time in soybean determined that the chromosomal region containing GmPRR3b was
associated with the flowering time (Li et al., 2019d; Li et al., 2019e; Zhou et al., 2015a).
However, the functional mechanism of this locus, including GmPRR3b, is still unclear. In this
study, we found that GmPRR3b is a direct repressor of the flowering enhancer GmCCAla
(Wang et al., 2019). Moreover, GmCCAla acts as a direct activator of J which targets and
represses the key legume-specific flowering repressor El. Hence, our data established a
pathway linking the central circadian clock to flowering time regulation in soybean (Figure
7G). We deduced that the full-length GmPRR3b ancestral form (with CCT domain, such as
GmPRR3bH4 acts to delay flowering in non-inductive LD conditions. The gain of a stop codon in
the truncated form GmPRR3b' H6, leading to the loss of the CCT domain, reduces protein function
and causes early flowering trait. Whereas complete knockout of GmPRR3bH6 reduces the growth
rate of node in the vegetative stage (Figure 7F and Supplemental Figure 19), which may
prolong the vegetative stage for preparation of floral transition. Taken together, these
possibilities warrant further investigation to illustrate the mechanism of how GmPRR36H6
does confer better agronomic traits than other haplotypes.
METHODS
Plant materials and growth conditions
A panel of 279 landraces was selected from a Chinese primary core collection to capture as
much of the representatives of diversity of the collection of soybean landraces present in the
Chinese National Soybean GeneBank (CNSGB) as possible (Qiu et al., 2013). These
landraces were planted in two experimental fields, Wuhan city in Hubei province (30.5 ON,
12



Journal Pre-proof
114.3 E), and Beijing city (40.1 ON, 116.7 °E) with two replicates in 2015. Flowering time
was scored in Beijing and Wuhan test sites, maturity time and plant height were scored only
in Wuhan site according to Qiu et al.(Qiu et al., 2006) since only a small part of landraces
(127 landraces, 45.5% of 279 landraces) were mature properly in the Beijing site. To confirm
the flowering dates and periods, wild-type (Cultivar Tianlong 1) and transgenic soybean were
grown under natural condition from May to October in a field in Beijing (40.1 ON, 116.7 E),
LD conditions (16 h light/ 8 h dark, 27°C), or SD conditions (8 h light/ 16 h dark, 27°C) in a
controlled growth chamber. To investigate a series of agronomic traits of mature soybean
under natural condition, whole plants were harvested and dried for two weeks to measure the
following agronomic traits, including node number, plant height, grain number per plant, and
yield per plant.
DNA extraction, sequencing, and SNP calling
Genomic DNA was extracted from each sample using the CTAB method and prepared in
libraries for sequencing using a TruSeq Nano DNA HT sample preparation kit (Illumina, USA)
following the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, the genomic DNA samples were
fragmented by sonication to a size of x350 bp, then end-polished, A-tailed, and ligated with
the full-length adapters for Illumina sequencing with further PCR amplification. Index codes
were added to facilitate the differentiation of sequences from each sample. The PCR products
were purified (AMPure XP bead system; Beckman Coulter, USA) and the libraries were
analyzed for their size distribution using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies,
USA) and quantified using RT-PCR. The libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq
X platform (Illumina). To ensure reliable reads without artificial bias, the low-quality paired
reads (2 10% unidentified nucleotides (N); > 10 nucleotides alignedto the adaptor, allowing K
10% mismatches; > 50% bases with a Phred quality less than 5) were removed. The
remaining high-quality paired-end reads were mapped to the Glycine max Wm82.a2.vl
reference genome using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner software with the command 'mem -t 4 -k
32 -M' (Li and Durbin, 2009). To reduce mismatches generated by the PCR amplification
before sequencing, the duplicated reads were removed with the help of SAMtools
(v0.1.19)(Li et al., 2009). After alignment, SNP calling on a population scale was performed
with the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, version v3.8) with the HaplotypeCaller method.
Subsequently, to exclude SNP-calling errors caused by incorrect mapping, only high-quality
SNPS (SNP in which heterozygosity according with Hardy Weinberg expectation, missing
ratio of samples within population < 10% and minor allele frequency (MAF) N 0.01 ) were
retained for subsequent analyses (Wang et al., 2018b).
GWAS analysis
Association analysis for flowering time and maturity time with 6,341,742 SNPS were
13



Journal Pre-proof
performed using Compressed Mixed Linear Model (CMLM) in the GAPIT program to account
for sample structure in 279 landraces (Lipka et al., 2012). The first four principal components
were included as fixed effects. With the number of SNPS analyzed (n == 6,341,742), the
threshold for significance was estimated to be approximately P = 1 X 10-7 (that is, 1/6,341,742)
by the Bonferroni correction method. The pair-wise r was calculated between significant
SNPs and its two sides 1Mb-context SNPS, the LD block region of QTL was defined by its
farthest 1Mb-context SNPs with a 7 N 0.8 in each side.
Selection signal detection
Nucleotide diversity Or was calculated using VariScan (v2.0.3) and fixation index (FST) was
calculated using VCFtools (v0.1.14) (Danecek et al., 2011). These population statistics were
analyzed using the sliding-window approach (20-kb windows with 10-kb increments).

Plasmid construction and generation oftransgenic plants
To construct H6-YFP and YFP-H6 plant transformation plasmids, coding DNA sequence
(CDS) of GmPRR3bH6 (1,878 bp) was amplified from the cDNA of young leaves of Williams
82 using primer Attb-H6-F and Attb-H6-R and inserted into the overexpression vector
pEarleyGate 101 or pEarleyGate 104 by the Gateway system following the manufacturer's
instructions (Invitrogen). To generate the CRISPR/Ca9-engineered Gmprr3b mutant, gRNAS
were designed using CRISPR-P website Chtp.lcrispr.hzau.cdu.cm, The 19-bp DNA fragment
coding the gRNA was inserted into the pCas9-AtU6-SgRNA plasmid at the Xball site. The
CRISPR/Cas9 expression vector was constructed with Cas9 CDS driven by Arabidopsis
RPS5A promoter and the customized gRNA transcribed by Arabidopsis U6 promoter (Tsutsui

Journal Pre-proof
and Higashiyama, 2017). Above expression plasmids were individually introduced into
Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 via electroporation and then transformed into
wild-type soybean (Tianlong 1, Ele2E3E4 and GmPRR36H6 background) by the
cotyledon-node method (Paz et al., 2006).
Sample Collection, RNA isolation and qRT-PCR analysis
To study the tissue-specific expression pattern of GmPRR36H6 in various tissues, Williams 82
plants were grown under LD conditions for three weeks. The root, hypocotyl, cotyledon,
unifoliolate leaves, trifoliolate leaves, stem, and shoot apical samples were collected 4 h after
the light was turned on. To analyze the rhythmic expression pattern of GmPRR3bH6 Williams
82 plants were grown under LD or SD conditions for three weeks. The second fully expanded
trifoliolate leaves were collected every 4 h during a 24 h LD or SD photoperiod, and then a 24
h continue light period (free-running condition). To compare dynamic transcription levels of
indicated genes in WT and YFP-H6 transgenic plants, the second fully expanded trifoliolate
leaves of 3-week-old plants grown under LD conditions were collected every 4h during a 24
h LD photoperiod and then a 24 h free-running period. To compare gene transcriptional levels
in WT and Gmprr3b mutant plants, the second fully expanded trifoliolate leaves were
collected at ZT4 and ZT12 from 3-week-old plants under LD conditions. To analyze the
GmPRR3b expression level in different accessions carrying H4 or H6, the second fully expanded
trifoliate leaves were collected at ZT4, ZT8, ZT12 under LD conditions or at ZTO, ZT4, ZT8
under SD conditions from 3-week-old plants. All above samples were used to extract total
RNA using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For qRT-PCR, the first complementary DNA and
cDNA were synthesized from DNase-treated total RNA (3 ug, reaction total volume 20 ul)
using a reverse transcription kit (TRAN). qRT-PCR was performed in 96-well optical plates
using a SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Takara) and a Roche Light Cycler 480. The mRNA level
of GmActin was used as the internal control. Three independent biological replicates were
analyzed, and three replicate reactions were used for each sample.
Subcellular Localization in soybean mesophyll protoplasts
To investigate the subcellular localization of indicated proteins, the coding sequences of
GmPRR36"4 GmPRR3bH6 GmPRR3bHom were inserted into PA7-YFP vector at the BamHI
and Smal sites using the In-fusion system (Clontech), to generate the H4-YFP, H6-YFP,
H6"-YFP transient expression constructs driven by 35S promoter. PA7-YFP empty vector was
used as control. Plasmids were transformed into soybean mesophyll protoplasts using our
previous method (Xiong et al., 2019). The subcellular localization images were captured
under the Zeiss LSM780 confocal laser scanning microscope and processed using ZEN 2009
Light Edition software.

ChIP qRT-PCR Assay
ChIP assay was performed following the protocol described previously with some
modifications (Zhang et al., 2016). 4 g leaves of the 4-week-old plant or hairy root callus of
indicated genotypes grown under LD conditions were collected 8 h after the light was turned
on. Tissues were incubated twice in 30.8 mL formaldehyde buffer (0.4 M Suc, 10 mM
Tris-HCI (pH 8.0), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM EDTA, and 1% (v/v)
formaldehyde) and vacuumed for 15 min each time. Then 1.6 mL of 2 M Glycine buffer was
added to stop cross-linked reaction for 5 min under vacuum. The cross-linked material was
repeatedly rinsed with ddH,O to remove formaldehyde buffer, ground in liquid nitrogen,
resuspended in 15 mL Honda buffer (0.44 M Suc, 1.25% Ficoll, 2.5% Dextran T40, 20 mM
HEPES KOH (pH 7.4), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM PMSF,
and 1 tablet/50 mL of protease inhibitor cocktail), filtered with two layers of Miracloth and
centrifuged for 15 min at 2000 g, 4 D. Sediment was resuspended with 500 uL nuclei lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.8), 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 tablet/50 mL
of protease inhibitor cocktail), subjected to ultrasound (pulse on 15 S, pulse off 60 S, 5-6
times), centrifuged for 10 min at 13000 rpm, 40. 200 uL supernatant solutions were taken and
incubated with GFP-trap_A agarose beads overnight at 40, centrifuged (1 min, 1500 g, 40).
The precipitated DNA was recovered with water and used as templates for qRT-PCR. The
enrichment folds of three biological replicates were calculated as the ratio between the
transgenic sample and wild-type control sample using GmActin as the negative control.
Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
To construct the reporter plasmid, a 3,671 bp sequence corresponding to the J promoter was
amplified and inserted into pGreen0800-LUC vector. To construct the effector plasmid, the
full-length GmCCAla CDNA was amplified and inserted into the pA7-YFP vector. The
reporter and effector plasmids were transiently co-transformed into Arabidopsis mesophyll
protoplasts. The firefly luciferase (LUC) and Renilla luciferase (REN) activities were
quantified using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, United States). The
relative actively of J promoter was calculated as LUC to REN ratio of three biological
replicates.
RICE system to investigate gene expression
The GmCCAla-YFP and H6-YFP plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens
strain K599 which further infected the young seedlings of Tianlong 1 at the hypocotyl region
to induce transgenic hairy roots according to the previously reported method (Kereszt et al.,
2007). The hairy roots induced by Empty K599 was used as the wild-type control. The callus
induction medium (2.22 g / L Murashige & Skoog Basal Medium with Vitamins, 0.59 g /L
MES monohydrate, 30 g / L sucrose, 1 mg / L 2, 4-D, 0.1 mg / L 6-BA, 0.1 g/ L Timentin)

was prepared as previously described with minor modifications (Leshina and Bulko, 2014;
Wang et al., 2001). The transgenic roots were grown on the callus induction medium for two
weeks under LD conditions. Those transgenic callus lines confirmed by qRT-PCR were
transferred to fresh callus induction medium for subculture. Three independent hairy root
callus lines of each indicated genotype were grown under indicated conditions and used for
transcriptional analysis or the ChIP assay of target genes. To compare the transcriptional
repression activity of GmPRR3bH4 and GmPRR3bH6 on GmCCAla, at least ten independent
YFP-H4 or YFP-H6 hairy root callus lines were generated for qRT-PCR analysis.
