QTL and confirmed 54 QTL identified in the individual GWAS. Of significant loci
identified, qMG-5.2 had effects on the highest number (9) of MGs, followed by E2,
E3, Dt2, qMG-15.5, E1, qMG-13.1, qMG-7.1, and qMG-16.1, which affected five
to seven MGs. A high number of genetic loci (8-25) that affected MGs 0-V were
observed. Stem termination genes Dtl and Dt2 mainly had significant allele varia-
tion in MGs II-V. Genome-wide associations for DTF,DTM, andreproductive period
(RP) in the diversity panel confirmed 15 QTL, of which seven were observed in MGs
