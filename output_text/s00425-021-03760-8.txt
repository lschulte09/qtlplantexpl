Abstract
Main conclusion Soybean phosphorous efficiency QTLS were identified and candidate genes were predicted using
chlorophyll fluorescence parameters through GWAS and RNA-seq.
Abstract Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient element for crop growth and development, lack ofP uptake seriously affects
yield in various crops. Photosynthesis is the basis of crop production, while it is very sensitive to P deficiency. It is of great
importance to study the genetic relationship between photosynthesis and P efficiency to provide genetic insight for soybean
improvement. In this study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using 292,035 SNPs and the ratios of
four main chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of 219 diverse soybean accessions under P deficiency and normal P across
three experiments. In total, 52 SNPS in 12 genomic regions were detected in association with the four main chlorophyll fluo-
rescence parameters under sufficient or deficient P levels. Combined it with RNA-seq analysis, we predicted three candidate
genes for the significant genomic regions. For example, the expression level of the candidate gene (Glyma. 18g092900) in
P deficiency tolerant accession was three times higher than that of P deficiency sensitive one under phosphorous deficiency
condition. This study provides insight into genetic links between photosynthetic and phosphorous efficiency and further
functional analysis will provide valuable information for understanding the underlying genetic mechanism to facilitate
marker-assisted breeding in soybean.
