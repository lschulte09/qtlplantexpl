[1]. Soybean breeders have been focusing on improving these traits in their cultivar develop-
ment. Highly heritable traits such as maturity and plant height can be selected at earlier stages,
whereas complex traits such as yield are tested over many years and environments throughout
the breeding pipeline. With the rapid development of genomic-related tools and DNA
sequencing technology, the improvement ofthe agronomic and yield-related traits ofinterest
could be performed faster.
Genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) are powerful tools to
understand the genetic architecture controlling complex traits ofimportance in soybean.
GWAShas been conducted to identify molecular markers associated with many agronomic
traits in soybean [2, 3]. To date, more than 60 markers identified through GWAS have been
reported to be associated with maturity in soybean [4-9]. These markers are distributed across
the soybean genome but more found on chromosome 16 (ntpe/hwwwsoybuscorg), Candi-
date genes such as Glymallg14150, Glyma16g02840, and Glymal6g03580 were studied in
detail and found to control maturity in soybean [9]. The most describedloci affecting maturity
in soybean are E1-E10 and IJ [10]. Efforts towards identifying significantloci controlling plant
height in soybean via GWAS have also been undertaken. Recently, 68 markers affecting plant
height have been identified using GWAS [6, 7,9, 11, 12]. Out of these, 19 were mapped on
chromosome 19 (itps/hwww.soybasc.org), A total of11 candidate genes affecting plant
height have been reported [11, 12]. A total lof95 molecular markers associated with seed weight
have been previously identified in soybean, ofwhich 12 are located on chromosome four [1, 5,
6, 8, 11-16]. Eighteen potential candidate genes have been reported for seed weight in soybean
[1,9, 11, 14]. GWAS has been proven to be efficient in identifying molecular markers associ-
ated with yield in soybean as well. Four SNPs were found to be associated with yield across
multiple environments via GWAS of219 soybean accessions [12] and the candidate genes Gly-
ma.13g073900, Glyma.06g050300, Glyma.03g169700, and Glyma.03g171900 were found in the
vicinity ofthese SNPS. In addition, a total of139 soybean accessions were genotyped using the
BARCSOYSNP6K in order to conduct GWAS for yield, reporting a total ofsix significant SNPs
associated with yield, of which, four were located on chromosome 12 [11]. An additional study
also suggested six significant loci associated with yield in soybean [5]. Copley et al. [8] reported
three significant SNPs associated with yield through GWAS.
GS has allowed the estimation ofthe effects of Fall markers across the genome. The combina-
tion ofthe markers effect denominated genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVS) can be
used to predict the performance ofa line [17]. GS has been shown to outperform the tradi-
tional marker-assisted selection (MAS) in complex traits such as yield and seed weight [18].
The establishment ofGS for complex traits may allow faster genetics gain per unit oftime [18].
Matei et al. [19] showed that the selection cycle for yield and seed weight can be significantly
reduced using GS. Previous reports showed a discrepancy regarding the accuracy ofGS for
complex traits in soybean. Duhnen et al. [20] reported an accuracy of0.39 for yield in soybean,
whereas Jarquin et al. [21] reported accuracy ofup to 0.80 for soybean yield in an elite popula-
tion consisting of301 genotypes.
Association panels for GWASS should include a high degree of genetic diversity, and the
phenotypes should be accurately characterized in various environments [22]In this research, a
total of 250 soybean germplasm accessions including 60 mini core collections and 108 typical
cultivars from China and 82 foreign germplasms separately from the United States, South
Korea and Japan were used in GWAS and GS for yield, maturity, plant height and seed weight

over 3 years. This panel can contribute towards discovering new loci ofinterest and confirm-
ing the previously reported ones, which will significantly enhance breeding for agronomic
traits in soybean. In addition, GS-related studies in soybean still remain limited. Therefore, the
objectives of fthis study were to investigate the population structure within a soybean panel, to
perform GWAS and identify SNP markers regulating maturity, plant height, seed weight, and
yield, and to assess the accuracy ofGS for these traits.
Materials and methods
Plant materials and phenotyping
A total of 250 soybean accessions from Dr. Lijuan Qiu'slab (Chinese Academy Of Agricultural
Sciences) were used in the study (S1 Table). Soybean accessions were plantedin Shijiazhuang
(114'83'E, 38Â°03'N) in Hebei province, China with a randomized complete block design
(RCBD) ofthree replications during the growing seasons of 2008, 2009, and 2010. A total of90
soybean seeds were sown in three rows of 3 meters oflength spaced at 0.5 meters. Phenotyping
data were collected for maturity, plant height, seed weight, and yield.
ANOVA for each trait was conducted using PROC MIXED ofSASR V. 9.4. The statistical
model for the analysis was the following
Y,=u+ Gi + T + Ei with i == 1,2, 250 and j i 1,2,3
Yij was the response from the ith genotype in the ;th year, H was the overall mean, Gi repre-
sented the effect ofthe ith genotype (fixed effect), T; was the effect ofthe jth year (fixed effect),
and Eij was the experimental error associated with the ijth observation.
Genotyping
DNA was extracted from young soybean trifoliate using the CTAB (hexadecyltrimethyl lammo-
nium bromide) method [23]. DNA library was prepared using the restriction enzyme ApeKI
following the GBS protocol described by Elshire et al. [24] and DNA sequencing was per-
formed using GBS method [24, 25]. The 90-bp, pair-end sequencing was performed on each
soybean genotype using the GBS protocol by an Illumina HiSeq at the Institute of Genetics
and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy ofSciences, Beijing, China. The GBS dataset
contained 3.26 M short-reads or 283.74 Mbp of sequence for each accession. The short reads
were aligned to the soybean whole genome sequence (Wm82.al.v1) Chtps/www.soybasecorg

GaxinellatPhgslindaghpah, select=Gmal.01) using SOAPaligner/soap2 (http://soap.
genomics.org.cn) and SOAPsnp V. 1.05 was used for SNP calling [26, 27]. Approximately half
amillion SNPs were identified by SNP calling. The minor allele frequency (MAF) threshold
less than 5%, and SNPS with heterozygosity more than 10% and or over 15% missing data were
eliminated. A total of 10,259 high-quality SNPS were retained and used for further analysis.
Population structure analysis
Population structure was inferred using STRUCTURE 2.3.4through a Bayesian resampling
technique [28]. Out ofthe 10,259 filtered SNPS, a total of5,129 SNPS were randomly chosen
for inferring population structure (K). This approach is suitable when the complete set of
SNPs is computationally heavy as described by Huang et al. [29]. The analysis was run using
an admixture model along with a correlated lallele frequency model, which was independent of
each run [30].

Genome-wide association study and genomic selectionfor yield and related traits in soybean
A total of ften runs were performed for each estimated K. The Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) length ofthe burn-in period was 30,000 and the number ofMCMC iterations was
50,000. The identification ofoptimal K was performed using STRUCTURE Harvester (http:ll
taylorobiologyacdacdulstructuretlarvester) and based on the equation establishedby
Evanno et al. [31]. The inferred population structure K was used to generate the structure Q-
matrix consisting ofK vectors. Each soybean accession was assigned to a Q cluster using a cut-
off probability of0.55. Any soybean accessions that could not be grouped lin any ofthe clusters
would lbe considered as admixture. Population structure was visualized using STRUCTURE
PLOT with the option "sort by Q" [32].
Genome-wide association study (GWAS)
GWAS was conducted using a Bayesian Information and Linkage Disequilibrium Iteratively
Nested Keyway (BLINK) and run in R using the package 'BLINK' [29]. Significant SNPs were
those with an LOD value greater than 3 [33].
BLINK was an improved model version ofFixed and Random Model Circulating Probabil-
ity Unification (FarmCPU) and is statistically powerful and efficient in identifying significant
SNPs associated with a trait ofimportance [29]. FarmCPU involveda fixed-effect model
(FEM) and la random-effect model (REM), which were run iteratively. FarmCPU assumed an
even distribution of markers within the genome. However, this assumption was relaxed in
BLINK where a Linkage Disequilibrium information was used instead [29]. The REM part was
replaced by a second FEM in BLINK. The two FEM models used in BLINK were the following.
FEM (1) : y == M,b, + M,b, + + Mabk + M,d, +e,
FEM (2) Y = M,b, + M,bz + + M,b + e,
where Yi was the phenotypic data from the ith sample; Mil Mib2, : Mik were the genotypes
ofk pseudo QTNS, which were initially empty and with effects bi,bz > bk respectively;M,
represented the jth genetic marker oftheith sample; and e; was the residual having a distribu-
tion with mean zero and a variance 0
Candidate gene discovery
A 10 kb-genomic region spanning a significant SNP was used for candidate gene search using
the G. max Williams 82.a2 reference in Soybase (atps/www.soybascorg) [34]. The SNPs
associated with the combined data over three years for maturity date, plantheight, seed weight,
and yield were used for candidate gene discovery. Functional annotations (base on which
model) of each postulated candidate gene were also investigated using Soybase (https://www.
soybase.org/).
Genomic-selection and cross-validation
GS was conducted using a ridge regression best linear unbiased predictor (rrBLUP) model,
which is effective in estimating the effects ofloci controlling complex traits [35]. The rrBLUP
model was y = WGB + E [17]. In this equation, y represented the vector phenotypic data; B
denoted the marker effect with B-N(O,Ios); W represented the incidence matrix relating the
genotype to the vector phenotype; G was the matrix displaying the genetic marker; ande
referred to the random error. The solution for rrBLUP was B_hat = (Z'Z+ IA)Z"ywith
Z= WG. The ridge parameter was defined as A =l 010? B> where o. was the residual variance

and lop the marker effect variance. rrBLUP was carried out in R using the 'rrBLUP package
[36].
Cross-validation was conducted using 4 different approaches. The first approach consisted
of sampling accessions from and cross-validating within the 250 soybean genotypes (whole
panel), the genotypes belonging to subpopulation 1 (Q1) from structure analysis (Q1 panel),
and the genotypes from subpopulation 2 (Q2) from structure analysis (Q2 panel), respectively.
For each defined subgroup, the training and validation datasets were from the same year. In
the second approach the training dataset from a year was usedto predict the genotype's perfor-
mance in the succeeding year(s). In the third strategy, samples from the Q1 panel was used to
predict the Q2 samples' performance within the same year and vice versa. In the fourth strat-
egy, training the GS model with a dataset from the Q1 panel from a particular year to predict
the traits ofthe Q2 panel from another year and vice versa. Due to the relatively small sample
size of feach panel, 5-fold cross-validation was carried lout for GS involving the whole panel and
the Q1 panel, and 3-fold cross-validation was performed for GS using the Q2 panel. Doing SO
allowed for an accurate estimation ofthe Person's correlation coefficient (GS accuracy) that
was established based on a sample size (>30) that couldbe statistically valid under such
constraint.
ANOVA was conducted to assess the interaction effect ofyear and population type (whole
panel, Q1 panel, and Q2 panel) on GS accuracy using PROC MIXED ofSASR V. 9.4. The sta-
tistical model for this analysis was:
Yik= H ++ T, + + +YP + Ejk with i = 1,2,3.j=1,2,3, and k = 1, 2, 3 ,100
Yijk was the GS accuracy from the ith year using the ;th population type at the kth replication,
Ti represented the effect ofthe ith year (fixed effect), P; was the effect ofthe jth population type
(fixed effect), and Eijk was the experimental error associated with the ijkth observation.
Results
Phenotypic variation and correlation within traits
Data on yield and related trait were collected over 3 years on a total of250 soybean genotypes.
The broad-sense heritability (H?) of maturity, plant height, seed weight and yield was 0.74,
0.89, 0.94 and0.66, respectively. Maturity ranged from 77.3 to 139.0 days, and plant height
ranged from 18.5 cm to 162.9 cm over 3 years (S2 Table) (S1 Fig). Seed weight ranged from
3.13 (g/100 seeds) to 33.82 (g/100 seeds), and values for yield ranged from 649.4 to 4286.6 kg/
hm? over 3 years (S2 Table) (S2 Fig). Significant differences were identified between years and
genotypes for all traits (S3 Table).
To assess consistency across years, Pearson's correlation coefficients were also calculated
for each trait across years. The correlation between years was high for maturity, seed weight,
and plant height, and relatively moderate for yield. Among them, the high correlation was
found for maturity (r == 0.763) between 2008 and 2010, seed weight (r r= 0.876) between 2008
and 2010; Yield (r= 0.604) between 2008 and 2009, plant height (r= 0.848) between 2009 and
2010 (S4 Table).
Pearson'scorrelation coefficients (r) between maturity, plant height, seed weight, and yield
were computed. A significant positive correlation was found between plant height and matu-
rity (r = 0.439), and a negative correlation between plant height and Seed_weight (r= -0.257).
There were almost no correlation between maturity and seed weight, maturity and yield, seed
weight andyield, plant height and yield (S4 Table).

Population structure and genetic diversity analysis
SNP filtering resultedin 10,259 high-quality SNPs that were used for GWAS and GS. SNP
number per chromosome varied from 292 (chromosome 12) to 785 (chromosome 18), with an
average SNP number of513 per chromosome (S5 Table). The average minor allele frequency
(%) per chromosome ranged between 16.24% and 24.73%, with an average of 21.02% (S4
Table). The average percentage ofheterozygous SNPs per chromosome varied from 0.42% to
0.74%, with an average of0.59%. There was no significant discrepancyin the average percent-
age of fmissing SNPS per chromosome (S5Table).
STRUCTURE Harvester indicated a delta K peak at K equal to 2 (S3A Fig), indicating that
the panelinvolving the 250 soybean genotypes consisted oftwo subpopulations. The bar plot
from STRUCTURE 2.3.4 showed the two-well differentiated subpopulations with an extremely
low level of admixture (S3B Fig). The mean inbreeding coefficients ofthe subpopulation rela-
tive to the total population were 0.565 and 0.043 for the subpopulation 1 and subpopulation 2,
respectively (S6 Table). The average distances between individuals in the same cluster were
0.332 (subpopulation 1) and 0.154 (subpopulation 2) (S6 Table). The overall proportions of
membership of agenotype within each cluster were 0.567 and 0.433 for subpopulation 1 and
subpopulation 2, respectively (S6 Table). The average allele frequency divergence among popu-
lations was 0.095 (S6 Table).
Genetic diversity analysis was also carried out along with population structure as shown in
S3C Fig. A good correlation was foundbetween the genetic diversity analysis and the structure
analysis. The admixture genotypes were randomly scattered in the phylogenetic tree.
Genome-wide association study (GWAS)
A total of 20 SNPS associated with maturity were identified (Table 2). These SNPS were distrib-
uted across the soybean genome (Fig 1) with chromosome 20 having the most significant
SNPs. The top five SNPs with the highest LOD values were located on chromosomes 10, 13, 9,
8, and 1 (Table 2). The t-test ofthe difference between genotypic class from the aforemen-
tioned SNPS was significant except for Chr13_33362588 (S4A-S4E Fig) (Table 2). A totalof31
SNPs associated with plant height were identified(Table 1). The top five SNPs were found lon
chromosomes 5, 19, and 20 (S6 Fig) (Table 1). The t-test ofthe data from the two genotypic
classes defined by the aforementioned SNPS was significant (S4F-S4] Fig).
A total of37 SNPS were found to be associated with seed weight (Table 2). The top five sig-
nificant SNPs were located on chromosomes 4, 9, 1, 17, and 8, respectively (S7 Fig) (Table 2).
T-test analysis was significantbetween genotypic class for these SNPs (S4K-S40 Fig). Ofthe
37 SNPS associated with the average seed weight over three years, 10 were located on chromo-
some 10 (Table 2). A total of 23 significant SNPS were identified for yield (Table 1) (S5D Fig).
The five most significant SNPs were located on chromosomes 9, 19, 8, 10, and 7, respectively
(Table 2). The variation between each genotypic class definedby the aforementioned SNPs
was visualized in S5P-S5T Fig. Ofthe 23 significant SNPS, 6 were located on chromosome 10
(Table 2). Ofthe 6 significant SNPS found on chromosome 10, 3 were mapped within a 3-Mb
genomic region (Table 2), indicating a strong likelihoodofQTL(s) affecting soybean yieldin
this region.
Candidate genes selection
Candidate genes found within a 10-kb genomic region harboring a significant SNP associated
for maturity, plantheight, seed weight, and yield were investigated. For maturity, 20 significant
SNPS were identified (Table 1). A total of 14 were mapped to genomic regions harboring anno-
tated genes in Soybase (www.soybase.org). The annotated genes had la wide variety of

what was foundfor seed weight, only one candidate gene was identified on chromosome 10
which harbored 10 SNPs associated with yield (Table 2). Most of the candidate genes encoded
transpiration factors and transferases.
Genomic selection (GS) in yield and related traits
Prediction accuracy for yield and yield-related traits were calculated by using a 5-fold cross-
validation within the 250-soybean accession panel(Fig 2) (S7 Table). The between-year varia-
tion was relevant for yield where the highest prediction accuracy was 0.72 in 2008 and the low-
est one was 0.50 in 2010 (Fig 2) (S7 Table). The prediction accuracy was also calculated using
the two subpopulations derived from structure analysis. Cross-validation using all 250 soybean
accessions and samples from the Q1 group provided a similar trend as shown in Fig 2, Com-
pared to the whole panel, prediction accuracy for maturity was reducedin Q1 panelbut
increasedin Q2 panel (Fig 2). On average, the prediction accuracy was the highest for seed
weight (0.84) and was the lowest for maturity (0.47) (S7 Table). Interestingly, prediction accu-
racy averaged 0.64 with a less variation between traits and across years when samples from Q2
were used to estimate prediction accuracy of seed weight (Fig 2). In addition, accuracy for pre-
dicting maturity was the best using Q2 samples (Fig 2) (S7 Table). The ANOVA results indi-
cated a statistically significant interaction effect between the year and population type on the
prediction accuracy ofGS for maturity, plantheight, seed weight, and yield (S8 Table). The
results indicated that year and population structure were important factors to take into
account when evaluating the prediction accuracy in the GS approach.

Prediction accuracy using datasets from different years had similar trends to within-year
cross validation (Figs 2 and 3). Overall, there is a lack cofconsistencybetween prediction accu-
racy and the training year across traits and population types. This couldbe explained lby the
significant interaction effect ofpopulation structure and years on prediction accuracy of plant
height, seed weight, and yield (S9 Table). Yield in 2010 was better predicted using dataset from
2009 than using yield data obtained in 2008 when all samples within the panel and individuals
from Q2 were used for cross-validation, respectively (Fig 3) (S10 Table). However, plantheight
in 2010 was better predicted by the dataset recorded in 2008 for all sample- and Q1 sample-
cross validation. Different results were found for plant height when cross-validation was

carried out using individuals from the Q2 group (Fig 3). Genomic prediction appeared to be
year-independent but subpopulation-dependent for maturity (Fig 3) (S10 Table). ANOVA
results showed that there was no significant interaction between population structure and year
in predicting maturity (S9 Table). In addition, year effect on prediction accuracy of fmaturity
was not significant (S9 Table). However, the prediction accuracy for maturity was heavily
influenced by population structure (S9 Table). Maturity could be better predicted than the
other traits when samples from the group Q2 were used for cross-validation (Fig3)
(S10 Table).
Prediction accuracy was also calculated using samples from Q1 as the training set and sam-
ples from Q2 as the testing set and vice versa. For cross-validation using data from the same
year (S11 Table), a discrepancy in prediction accuracy was found when samples from one sub-
population were used to predict the ones from the other group (S8 Fig). Overall, prediction
accuracy was slightly higher for most traits when the GS model was trained using samples
from subpopulation 1 (S8 Fig). This difference was substantial for maturity. The average pre-
diction accuracy for maturity was 0.49 and 0.20 for Q1-based training set and Q2-based popu-
lation, respectively (S11 Table). Unlike the two previous approaches which cross-validation
was carried out using within-subgroup samples, the variation of prediction accuracy between
years was more pronounced when the prediction was done across subpopulations (S8 Fig).
Also, the interaction effect of population structure and year on prediction accuracy was

significant for maturity, plant height, seed weight and yield (S8 Table). When the training set
was taken from Q1 in order to predict yield of Q2, prediction accuracy was 0.72 and 0.41 for
2009 and 2008, respectively (S11 Table). A similar trend was found for yield when the training
samples were derived from Q2 to test on Q1 (S8 Fig).
In addition to performing a within-year prediction accuracy using two subpopulations,
trait prediction for other years of a genetically-distant population subset was also conducted.
Overall, results indicated a similar trendto what was found using a within-year prediction
approach (S9 Fig). The interaction effect of population structure and year on prediction accu-
racy was significant for maturity, plant height, seed weight, and yield (S9 Table). Prediction
accuracy for most traits was slightly higher when the samples from Q1 were used to train the
prediction model (S12 Table). Training the model on Q1 resulted in prediction accuracy of
yield being 0.62, 0.40, 0.36, and 0.41 when the training/testing year was 2008/2009, 2008/2010,
2009/2010, average 2008_2009/2010, respectively (S12 Table). When the prediction model was

trained under Q2. The improvement was achieved by averaging the training set data from
2008 and 2009 to predict the testing set in 2010. Prediction accuracy was 0.47, 0.07, and 0.60
for plant height, maturity date, and seed weight, respectively, using the 2008 data from the Q2
samples to predict the 2010 data from the Q1 samples (S9 Fig) (S12 Table). By taking the com-
bined data from 2008 and 2009 to establish the training set, plant height, maturity date, and
seed weight ofthe Q2 samples were predicted with an accuracy of0.52, 0.09, and 0.68, respec-
tively (S12 Table). These results indicated that prediction accuracy was impactedby multiple
factors such as population structure and the variable year from which the training set was
established.
Discussion
GWAS was conducted using a BLINK model. BLINK is one the latest and most improved sta-
tistical models to conduct GWAS [29]. Spurious associations could be reducedby incorporat-
ing population structure and Kinship effects into the GWAS model [37]. This has been

Genome-wide association study and genomic selectionfor yield and related traits in soybean
establishedinto the BLINK algorithm [29]. Therefore, we did not run the MLM (Q + K) of
Tassel 5 for GWAS [38] since previous investigations had successfully demonstrated that
BLINK had more statistical power in identifying true associations and reducing false positives
for a large number of traits [29]. The only purpose ofrunning population structure (Q) in this
study was to assess GS accuracy between two unrelated subpopulations, which will be further
discussedin this report.
A total of20, 37, 31, and 23 SNPs were found to be significantly associated with maturity,
seed weight, plant height, andyield, respectively, using the combined data obtained over 3 years
(Tables 1 and 2). Diers et al. [39] also reported la similar range of SNP number associated with
these traits using a nested association mapping (NAM) soybean population. A total lof19, 29,
15, and 23 SNPS were reported to be associated with maturity, seed weight, plantheight, and
yield, respectively [39]. Assefa et al. [40] found la total of14, 10, and 9 SNPs associated with seed
weight, plant height, and yield, respectively, based upon a GWAS study involving a total of419
soybean accessions. After SNP validation is performed, the information from this report could
be used in trait introgression efforts in soybean breeding programs. This has been successfully
demonstratedby Hegstad et al. [41] who introgressedlarge-fict QTL regions from commer-
cial soybean cultivars with high yield into the Corteva Agriscience soybean accessions.
Previous investigations reported a total ofmore than 60 loci controlling maturity in Soybase
(htps/www.soybasc.org) Chromosome 16 has been shown to harbor the most significant
lociaffecting soybean maturity. Ofthe 20 SNPs found tobe associated with the average matu-
rity over 3 years in this study, one was mapped at 31 Mb on chromosome 16. Diers et al. [39]
found a total of19 regions for maturity on chromosome 16. However, Wang et al. [42]
reported a significant discrepancy in SNPS associated with maturity across multiple environ-
ments, which was also consistent with that ofreported in this study where different SNPS were
reported in different years with different environmental conditions. A cluster of significant
SNPS were identified in a 232-kb region ofchromosome 20. This region spanned a significant
SNP associated with maturity that was reported by Zatybekov et al. [43]. A high-LOD SNP
(LOD>10), Chr10_45903960, associated with maturity was also found on chromosome 10. A
total of 10 loci on chromosome 10 were reported to be associated with maturity in Soybase
Chtps/www.soybascorg). One ofthose lociharbored the SNP Chr10_45903960. Two of the
SNPS associated with maturity, Chr10_45903960 and Chr20_41339091, were located into the
E2 and E4 loci that have been reported to control maturity in soybean [44]. For the plant
height-related SNPS, of31 SNPs found to be associated with the average height over 3 years in
this study, a new plantheightlocus was mapped to chromosome 20 (Chr20_43000412,
LOD = 6.76, MAF = 43.83%). Previous investigations showed discrepancy in terms ofSNP
location. Zatybekov et al. [43] reported two SNPs significantly associated with plantheight on
chromosome 9 and 20, which were mapped at 42 Mb and 8 Mb, respectively. Our results did
not indicate any plant-height associated SNPS on chromosome 9, whereas the one mapped on
chromosome 20 is about 7.5 Mb away from that of reported by Zatybekov et al. Ofthe 68 loci
associated with plant heighti in Soybase (htpe/www.soybusc.orp) 19 loci were found on
chromosome 19. The plant height-associated SNP with the highest LOD value found in this
study was mapped on chromosome 19. We found that all significant SNPs associated with
plant height and mapped on chromosome 19 overlapped with the Dtl locus, which has been
well-described for controlling plant height in soybean [7]. These findings suggest that the pres-
ent investigation contributes towards enriching SNP markers associated with plant theight,
which is essential in efficiently establishing a breeding pipeline for agronomic trait improve-
ment in soybean.
Zhang et al. [1] reported that seed weight was a complex trait controlled by a large number
ofloci. This statement appeared tobe sound when taking into account the number ofSNPs

associated with maturity reportedin this study. To date, more than 100 QTLs affecting seed
weight have been reported (htpe/hwww.soybascorg). A large number ofthese QTLs were
mapped on chromosomes 2, 4,5,7,17, 18, and 20 [39, 43]. Our results revealed a SNP with an
LOD of 22.58 at 37 Mb on chromosome 4, indicating the likelihood ofa strong QTL affecting
seed weight in this region. In addition, a large cluster ofSNPs were found on chromosome 10.
Some ofwhich overlapped with previously reported seed weight-related QTLs (https://www.
soybase.org/). For yield, previous reports showed that SNP markers associated with yield were
scattered across the soybean genome. To date, more than 170 loci have been associated with
yield in soybean Chtpe/hww.soybuscorg). Zatybekov et al. [43] mapped SNP markers asso-
ciated with soybean yield on chromosomes 14, 17, and 20. Diers et al. [39] reported 23 loci
affecting soybean yield on chromosome 16 alone. Two ofthe SNPS on chromosome 19
reported in this study were in the vicinity ofa significant yield SNP marker identified by
Assefa et al. [40]. Despite the lack ofoverlapping SNPs between traits, overlapping significant
loci were identified to control two or more traits. A 7.2-Mb region of chromosome 2 and
defined lby the SNP markers Chr02_12086588 and Chr02_19239630 were associated with
both seed weight and plantheight. A 9-Mb region ofchromosome 4 harboring the SNPs
Chr04_46043483, Chr04_46043518, and Chr04_36949349 was significantly associated with
both maturity date and seed weight. A genomic DNA sequence spanning a 450-Kb region of
chromosome 71 harbored the SNPs Chr07_33588669 and Chr07_7610107 and was associated
with seed weight and yield, respectively. In addition, a 270-Kb region of chromosome 8
definedby the significant SNP markers Chr08_47483065 and Chr08_47747059 were associ-
ated with both seed weight and yield. One ofthe most important regions reported in this inves-
tigation is defined by an 11.5-Mb region of chromosome 10 containing the significant SNPS
Chr10_18370776, Chr10_19170955, Chr10_19620114, Chr10_20805615, Chr10_24454215,
Chr10_24773660, Chr10_29894008, Chr10_19477000, Chr10_24773517, Chr10_26343503,
Chr10_27017034, and Chr10_29778879. These significant SNPS were associated with seed
weight and yield. A 4-Mb region ofchromosome of fchromosome 19 was found to be associ-
atedwith maturity, plant height, and yield in soybean, which was in agreement with a study
investigated by Assefa et al. [40]. A 5.4-MB region ofchromosome 20 harboredloci that were
associated with maturity, plant height, and seed weight. These findings were consistent with
previously reported studies [39, 43].
Our results suggested that maturity-associated candidate genes encoding Leucine-rich
repeat proteins were prevalent. Osakabe et al. [45] showed that LRR proteins acted as a key
regulator for maturity in plant. In addition, Jinn et al. [46] reported that these proteins were
also involved in floral organ abscission. These previous investigations supported that the LRR
domains foundin this study could be good candidate genes for maturity in soybean and could
be further investigated towards validation. The findings indicated O-methyltransferase being a
candidate gene for maturity in soybean. Held et al. [47] found that O-methyltransferase
related genes were highly expressed during cell maturation in maize. The candidate genes asso-
ciated with plant height consisted oftranscription factors, kinases, andbiomolecule transport-
ers. One ofthese transcription factors is NF-Y alpha-related. Zhao et al. [48] reported that this
transcription factor regulated plant growth, indicating that NF-Y alpha-related could be a
good candidate gene for plant height in soybean. The SNP markers associated with plant
height and mapped in the Dtl locus on chromosome 19 were in the vicinity of a gene that
encodes for a tetratricopeptide repeat protein (TPR). However, the role ofTPR domains in
affecting plant height has been poorly investigated. The candidate genes associated with seed
weight that were reported in this study had diverse functional annotations. A large number of
candidate genes playing significant roles in seed development were hormone-signaling [49].
However, no candidate genes involved in hormone signaling pathways were identified. A large

number of candidate genes found for yield were transcription factors and transferases. These
results were consistent with that ofreportedby Diers et al. [39] who reported candidate tran-
scription factors that could affect yield in soybean. Candidate genes associated with maturity,
plantheight, seed weight, and yield were reported lin this study. Additional investigations
would be required to validate these candidate genes.
Prediction accuracy for maturity, plant height, seed weight, and yield was assessed. Howard
and Jarquin [50] reported that GS performed better than phenotypic selection in soybean
when dealing with complex trait. In this study, we found that the trend ofprediction accuracies
were similar for all traits when all samples and Q1 samples, respectively, were used for cross
validation (Figs 2 and 3). Interestingly, prediction accuracy for plant height was lower than
yield when cross-validation was conducted using data from the same year from all samples
and Q1 samples, respectively. These results were different from that ofreportedby Ma et tal.
[51] who also used a one-year data to estimate prediction accuracy for plant height and yield
in soybean. They reported a prediction accuracy of0.86 and 0.47 for plantheight and yield,
respectively. However, when cross-validation was conducted using data from different years
regardless ofthe subpopulation, prediction accuracy was higher for plant height than yield.
This could be explainedby the fact that plant height has higher heritability than yield [51],
thus resulting in a higher genomic prediction accuracy. In addition, inconsistency in results
has been found in previous studies investigating prediction accuracy for yield in soybean. Jar-
quin et al. [21] suggested an accuracy of0.64 for yield, whereas Stewart-Brown et al. [52] and
Duhnen et al. [20] reported an accuracy of0.26 and 0.39, respectively. We have also
highlighted the effect ofpopulation structure on the prediction accuracy. The results indicated
that prediction accuracy for maturity was heavily affected by population structure. This could
be explainedby the fact maturity can cause a structure within a population, thus using matu-
rity data from one subpopulation to predict the maturity data from another unrelated subpop-
ulation will decrease the prediction accuracy. We have also found that year can significantly
affect prediction accuracy, implying that updating the training model each year will be neces-
sary for efficiently establishing a GS pipeline within a breeding program for agronomic trait
improvement in soybean.
Conclusion
In this report, significant differences in plant height, maturity, seed weight, and yield were
identified among the genotypes. In addition, the year effect was also significant. Molecular
markers associated with the above traits were identified. GS accuracy in this study varies from
low to moderate and is affected by population structure and year. The SNP markers identified
in this study contributed towards enriching SNP markers associated with the above traits,
which were essential in efficiently establishing a marker-assisted selection (MAS) and GS pipe-
line for agronomic trait improvementin soybean.
