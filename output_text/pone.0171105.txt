ferent regions ofthe genome [10, 11).
In order to enforce improvement in crops, SNP markers have turned out to be a potential
tool in soybean breeding programs [4, 12]. SNP markers have also been employed in other
important crops such as maize [13], rice [14] and wheat [15]. SNP markers have enabled Ito
improve the odds of fsuccess in a diversity of applications in soybean breeding programs,
including positional cloning, association analysis, QTL mapping, and the determination of
genetic relationships among individuals [16, 17].
Looking at LD from an analytical point ofview, ithas been seen that it is best described
using the haplotype-block approach [10]. The haplotype block is defined as a genomic region
where a set ofneighboring polymorphic loci (allelic variants) are in strong linkage disequilib-
rium in a population ofinterest [9, 18]. Hamblin and Jannink [9] using coalescent simulations
to compare single-SNP and haplotype markers, found that, across a range of plausible scenar-
ios, the average power of2- and 3-SNP haplotype markers to detect a QTL exceeds that ofsin-
gle-SNP markers. The specific haplotype blocks of soybean chromosomes can be associated
with artificially selected phenotypic variations ofmany breeding generations [19] facilitating
the identification of genes related with traits ofinterest [11].
It could be beneficial for GWAS to use haplotype information in making marker-phenotype
associations [7] and could also compensate the bi-allelic limitation ofSNP markers, and sub-
stantially improve the efficiency of QTL detection [13, 20, 21]. In fact, according to Abdel-
Shafy et al. [8], GWAS using haplotype information in addition to using single-SNP couldpro-
vide new insights on the genetic determinants that are not capturedby the single-marker
approach. Thus, the aim ofthis study was to identify genomic regions that control 100-seed
weight (SW), plant height (PH) and seed yield (SY) in a soybean association mapping panel
using individual SNP markers andhaplotype information.
Material and Methods
Plant material and growing conditions
The association panelconsisted of 169 genotypes that represent the core cultivars usedby Brazilian
farmers from 1990 to 2010, and some ofthese were key progenitors in soybean breeding programs
of Brazil. The cultivars were field-evaluatedin four sites of southern Brazil: Cascavel (24'52'55"S
53"32'30"W), Palotina (2421'07"S 53'4525"W), Primavera do Leste (15°34'38"S 54'20'42"W)and
Rio Verde (1745495510149W) (Table A in S1 File). Field trials were conducted using a ran-
domized complete block design with two replicates. Fertilizer and field management practices rec-
ommended for optimum soybean production were used according to Embrapa [22].
SNP genotyping
The cultivars were genotyped with 6,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) using the Illu-
mina BARCSOYSNP6K BeadChip, which corresponds to a subset of SNPs from the SoySNP50K

BeadChip [12] (Table A in S2 File). Genotyping was conducted by Deoxi Biotechnology Ltda
R, in Aracatuba, Sao Paulo, Brazil. A total of3,780 polymorphic and non-redundant SNP
markers, with greater than 10% minor allele frequency (MAF) and missing data lower than 25%
were used for subsequent analysis. Heterozygous markers were treated as missing data accord-
ing to Hwang et al. [2].
SNP-based haplotype blocks
941 haplotype blocks (characterized from the 3,780 SNPS) were used in this genome-wide asso-
ciation study (Table B in S2 File). Haplotype blocks were constructed using the Solid Spine
method implemented in the software Haploview [23]. This method considers that the first and
last markers in a block are in strong LD with all intermediate markers, thereby providing more
robust block boundaries. A cutoffof1% was used, meaning that ifaddition ofa SNP to a block
resulted in a recombinant allele at a frequency exceeding 1%, then that SNP was not included in
the block. The SNPs markers significantly associated with SY, PH and SW andlocated at the
same haplotype blocks were considered as a potential region ofputative loci controlling the
traits under study.
Population structure
A Bayesian model-based method implementedin the program InStruct [24] was used to infer
the population structure using 3,780 SNPS, which were selected as mentioned previously. The
posterior probabilities were estimated using five independent runs ofthe Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm for the numbers of groups genetically differentiated (k)
varying from 2 to 10, without prior population information. The MCMC chains were run with
5,000 burn-in period, followed by 50,000 iterations. The convergence ofthe log likelihood was
determinedby the value of fthe Gelman-Rubin statistic. The best estimate ofk groups was deter-
mined according to the lowest value ofthe average log(Likelihood) and Deviance Information
Criterion (DIC) values among the simulated groups [24], as defined by Spiegelhalter et al.[25]
DIC = D + pD
(1)
where D is a Bayesian measure of modelfit, and is defined as the posterior expectation ofthe
deviance (D = Eapl-2-Inf(y/0); pD is the effective number of parameters, which measures
the complexity ofthe model.
Phenotypic data analysis
The following agronomic traits were measured and field-evaluated in the growing season
2012/2013: Seed yield (SY), 100-Seed Weight (SW) and Plant Height (PH). A mixed linear
model was employed for phenotypic data analysis using the MIXED procedure in SAS (SAS
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). The model that represents the combined data analysis was the fol-

with the option LSMEANS ofMIXED procedure, which were used as a dependent variable in the

where f and 18, are the generalized least-squares estimates ofu and 8p respectively. To estimate
AEM for all cultivars at each of four locations, g was regarded as fixed and lb as random, as pro-
posed by Stich et al. [27]. Restricted Likelihood Ratio Test (RLRT) was calculated to confirm the
heterogeneity ofresidual variance (across locations) using the MIXED procedure ofSAS, accord-
ing the following:
RLRT = 2. log [L(Mwv)]

where MHv and Mcv are the models with heterogeneous and common (homogenous) variances,
respectively. The asymptotic distribution ofthe RLRT statistic is Chi-square with p degrees of
freedom (RLRT  2,), where pis the difference in the number of parameters included in the
MHv and Mcv models (in this case P = 3). Consequently, error variances were assumed to be het-
erogeneous among locations, which was computed using the REPEATED statement, option
GROUP, ofMIXED procedure.
Correlations among traits were determined following the method described by Holland
et al. [28], using the SAS macro (%macro correlation), which performs multivariate REML
(Restricted Maximum Likelihood) estimation ofvariance and covariance components.
Association mapping analysis
AEM values were used to perform single-SNP analysis and then haplotype-based genome-wide
association for the traits under consideration. In order to take into account the effects of popula-
tion structure and genetic relatedness among the cultivars, the following unified mixed-model
[29, 30] of association was employed (in matrix form):
y = Sa + Qv + Zu + €
(5)
whereyis a vector ofadjusted phenotypic observations; a isa vector ofSNP effects (fixed); v is a
vector of population structure effects (fixed); u is a vector of polygene background effects (ran-
dom); and l€ is a vector of residual effects. S, Q and Z are incidence matrices for a, vand u, respec-
tively. According to Yu et al. [29], the variances of u and E are Var(u) == 2Ko? and Var(E) == Ro,
respectively. This is a structured association model (Q model), which considers the genetic struc-
ture ofthe core collection included in the association mixed model. The kinship coefficient matrix
(K) that explains the most probable identity by state ofeach allele between cultivars was estimated
using the program TASSEL [31, 32]. Mixed linear models with Q andKby themselves, and MLM
considering Q + K models were also run in TASSEL [29, 32]. The Bayesian information criterion
(BIC) [33] was used for model selection, which is defined as:
BIC = -2 logl + P log(n)
(6)
where L is the restricted maximum likelihood for a determined model; p the number ofparameters
to be estimated in the model; and In the sample size. BIC values were computed using the TASSEL
program following Yu et al. [29]. Haplotype-based association mapping was performed by using
the Q + K model, following the unified mixed-model [29]. A limit of detection (LOD) value
higher than 3 was used as threshold P-value for both SNP- marker andhaplotype-trait associa-
tions [2]. Then, only significant SNPS or haplotypes were used Ito estimate the phenotypic variance
explainedby the markers. The percent of variation explained by both SNP markers and SNP-
basedhaplotypes was calculated by a regression analysis using TASSEL [32, 34]. The Chi-square

test was performed to check phenotypic differences among haplotype blocks using the CON-
TRAST option of GENMOD procedure ofSAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
Additionally, the genomic regions (or SNPs in haplotypes blocks) identified in this study
were compared to the genomic locations ofQTLs previously reported for the traits under
study. Genes, QTLs and markers annotated in Glymal.01 and NCBI RefSeqgene models in
SoyBase (www.soybase.org) were used as reference.
Results
Analysis ofvariance indicated that the effects of genotype (G), environment (E) and their
interaction (G x E) were statistically significant (p < 0.01) for all three traits under study (SY,
SW and PH). This result is in agreement with the mixed model analysis, in which the 169 culti-
vars presented significant differences at P < 0.01 in all traits. The statistical results offixed
effects for the complex traits are summarized in Table 1. The mean seed yield (SY) varied sig-
nificantly across locations. Soybean plants grown in Palotina had the lowest mean SY, while in
Rio Verde plants had the highest SY. Plant height (PH) was significantly increased in Cascavel,
while in Primavera do Leste PH was numerically decreased. However, plants in Primavera do
Leste had the highest mean in 100-seed weight (SW).
Estimates ofcorrelation coefficients among traits are shown in Table 2. SY was positively and
significantly correlated with SW in three sites (estimates varied from 0.29 to 0.47; P < 0.01). The
correlation estimate between SW and PH was not statistically different from zero, which was
observed lin all environments. On the other hand, there was no definite correlation between SY
and PH; i.e., the correlation coefficient (calculatedbetween these both traits) was negative in
Cascavel, but positive in Primavera do Leste and Rio Verde.

AGenome-Wide Association Studyfor Key Complex Traits in Soybean
Population structure
In the present study, population structure ofa soybean association panel consisting of169 cul-
tivars was investigated using a Bayesian clustering approach and la core set ofSNP markers.
According to the average log (likelihood) and the deviance information criterion (from the
posterior Bayesian clustering analysis), the most probable number of subpopulations is nine
(Fig A in S1 File). The probability ofmembership to each cluster indicates that 43% ofall geno-
types presented more than 50% of membership to their respective groups. However, most of
them had an admixed condition. In fact, each subpopulation contained admixed cultivars that
come from different soybean genetic breeding programs of Brazil (Fig A in S1 File, Table A in
S1 File).
SNP-based association analyses
For modelfit evaluation ofmixedlinear models with Q (structure) and K (kinship) matrices, the
results based on Bayesian information criterion consistently showed a better fit for the (Q + K)
model over the model that consider either Q or K alone (Table B in S1 File) for all data set (three
traits and four environments). As shown in the quantile-quantile (QQ) plots (B-G in S1 File Figs),
the observedP-values from models that only includeeither population structure (Q model) or
familial relatedness (K model), were significantly increased compared with the selected mixed
model. Thus, the mixed linear model that includes Q and K (Q + K model) reduced the excess of
low P-values (B-G in S1 File Figs). According to mixed-model analyses, six, seven and twenty-
eight SNPS were significantly associated with SY, SW and PH, respectively (Tables C, D and E in
S1 File).
Six SNPS were significantly associated with SY on three chromosomes across two locations
(Fig 1A and 1D),i.e., Cascavel (5) and Rio Verde (1). No significant SNPS were found in either
Palotina nor Primavera do Leste (Fig 1B and 1C). The SNP ss715614920 associated with SY in
Cascavel was identified on chromosome 13 at the intron region ofthe gene glymal3g25740,
which encodes a putative germinal-center associatednuclear protein-like [35] (Table Cin S1
File).
In Cascavel, the significant SNP ss715613203 (SY) was located in the same linkage disequi-
librium block Gm12_ Hap12 with the SNP Ss715613192, ss715613207 and ss715613219. For
this reason, this SNP is in linkage disequilibrium with the same genes and proteins associated
with this LD block: Gm12_Hap12, i.e., uncharacterized gene LOC102667945 and the putative
gene glymal2g075700 annotated as a double-stranded RNA-binding protein 2-like, which
encodes a ribonuclease III protein (Fig 2, Tables 3 and 4). This LD block is also tightly rlinked
to glymal2g075600, which encodes a senescence regulator in soybean. In addition, this LD
block is close to markers satt568 and satt192 SSR, which have been involved in seed protein
synthesis [36] and associated with QTLs of seed glycitein [37],respectively (Fig 2). The satt442
is a SSR marker located near to this haplotype region, which is associated to QTLs for seedpro-
tein, pod maturity and reproductive stage length in soybean. Importantly, this haplotype
region has also been associated with SW in Palotina and Primavera do Leste in this study. The
proportion ofphenotypic variation explained by SNP-SY associations ranged from 9.14% (i.e.,
SNP ss715614920 located on Chr13 in Cascavel) to 15.83% (SNP ss715593323 on Chr6 in Rio
Verde) (Table Cin S1 File).
Seven SNPs were significantly associated with SW on chromosomes 5, 7, 11 and 12 across
the locations under study (Fig 3A,3B and 3C). In Cascavel, the two SNPs associated with SW
(ie., ss715592623 and ss715592632) are in a genomic region on Chr5 that encodes an elonga-
tion factor Ts mitochondrial-like (LOC100784416) and a ferredoxin-NAD(P) reductase activ-
ity protein (glyma05g09390), respectively [35].

The SNPs ofthe Gm12_Hap12 were associated to SW in Palotina and Primavera do Leste
(Tables 3 and 4). Other SNPs associated to SW in Primavera do Leste were: ss715598558 and
ss715610817located on chromosome 7 and 11, respectively. The SNP ss715598558 is located
at the CDS region ofthe Glyma07g076800 gene, which encodes a transcription factor HEX,
containing HOX and HALZ domains in soybean [35]. In Rio Verde, no SNP were found asso-
ciated to SW (Table D in S1 File, Fig3D).
One-hundred seed weight (SW) is one ofthe major yield components having direct effect
on the final seed yield. For this trait, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained lby a sin-
gle genomic region found in this study was 9.92% in Cascavel (SNPS ss715592623 and
$s715592632). In Palotina, the phenotypic variation ranged from 12.33% (ss715613104) to
13.31% (ss715613203).In Primavera do Leste, marker-SW associations explained from 8.92%
(ss715613203) to 10.08% (ss715610817) ofthe phenotypic variation (Table D in S1 File).

Twenty-eight SNPS were significantly associated with PH across the four locations (Table E
in S1 File), ofwhich seventeen SNPS were found in Cascavel (Fig 4A), eleven in Palotina (Fig

showed no entry related with genes and/or molecular markers in the soybean database [35].
On the other hand, the SNPs ss715633774, ss715632400, ss715634905 and ss715622494 associ-

to a genomic region that encodes a heat shock cognate 70 kDa protein-like, as well as, other
SNPS co-associated with PH in Cascavel (Table E in S1 File). Similarly, the SNP ss715635468,
identified on chromosome 19, showed strong significant association to PH in Cascavel and
Palotina environments. In addition, it was related to glymal9g196000 gene, described as a
probable UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-peptide N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase SPINDLY gene
(Table E in S1 File) [35].
In Primavera do Leste, the SNP markers $s715619979, ss715637964 and ss715637991 were
located on intergenic regions and showed no encoded genes related to plant height [35]. The
same pattern was observed for the SNPS ss715592226 and Ss715592231, which were associated
to PH in Rio Verde. In contrast, the SNP markers ss715637988 and ss715619968 that were
associated to PH in Primavera do Leste are on a genomic region that encodes an uncharacter-
izedLOC100810047 (glyma20g28915) and a centromere-associated protein E-like (LOC1008
04944; glymal4g10050), respectively. Similarly, the genomic region on chromosome 5 (SNP
ss715592240 associated to PH in Rio Verde) has been found to be involved to the synthesis
ofa probable protein S-acyltransferase 5-like (LOC100788304; glyma05g38360). In fact, the
SNPS ss715592226 and ss715592231 were located in the same linkage disequilibrium block
(Gm5_Hap40).
The haplotype block 42, associated to PH on Chr19 (Gm19_Hap42), is a region containing
the Determinate stem 1 gene (Dtl; Glyma19g37890) at 18.6 kb upstream ofthe peak SNP
ss715635425 (Chr19_45000827; Table Ein S1 File and Table 5), which has been previously
associated with PH and days to maturity in soybean [4] (Fig 5). In addition, other marker-
yield associations have been previously identified at this region, seed yield 11-6, Plantheight
13-8 and Plant height 4-2 [38, 39] and associated with Dtl [40] (Fig 5).

Haplotype blocks associated with complex traits
The genome-wide haplotype association analysis (941 haplotypes) identified eleven, seventeen
and fifty-nine SNP-based haplotypes significantly associated with SY, SW and PH, respec-
tively. As expected, both the size (kb) and the number ofSNPs by LD block were highly vari-
able (Tables 3, 4 and 5). Most ofthe blocks identified for each trait are in euchromatic regions
according to the Glymal.01 genome assembly (Table Ain S2 File).
For SY in Cascavel, the haplotypes TAAT (Gm12_Hap12a) and TAAC (Gm12_Hap12b)
showed significant differences with the haplotype CGGT (Gm12_Hap12c). Gm12_Hap12a
and Gm12_Hap12b had a mean value of2567 kg ha -1 and 2381 kg ha -1 > respectively, while the
haplotype Gm12_Hap12c yielded a mean of1929 kg ha yield 19% and 25% lower than the
haplotypes Gm12_Hap12a and Gm12_Hap12b, respectively (Table 3). For SW,in Palotina,
the same haplotypes (Gm12 Hap12a and Gm12 Hap12b) showed statistical differences with
Gm12 Hap12c. In average, the haplotypes Gm12 Hap12a and Gm12 Hap12b had values of
11.4 g/100 seeds and 11.5 g/100 seeds, while the haplotype Gm12_Hap12c yielded 10.5 g/100
seeds (respectively 8% and 9% lower SW than Gm12_Hap12a and Gm12_ Hap12b). In Prima-
vera do Leste, the same haplotypes did not show statistical differences for SW. These haplo-
types had the following frequencies in this association mapping panel: 30% for Gm12_Hap12a,
44% for Gm12_Hap12b and 26% for Gm12_Hap12c, and explained together a phenotypic

Leste, respectively (Tables 3 and 4).
A discriminant haplotype was identified in a low frequency for PH in this association mapping
panel, i.e. the haplotype Gm19_Hap42b in which the plants had la mean of83.8 and 85.0 cm of
height in Cascavel and Palotina, respectively. In both environments, this haplotype showed statisti-
cal difference with the haplotyperesponsible for produce tallest plants (Gm19_Hap42a). Together,
these haplotypes explained a phenotypic variation of91.4% and 96% in Cascavel and Palotina,
respectively (Table 5). Another interestinggenomic region was located on Chr9 (Gm9_Hap24),
in which the haplotypes did not show statistical differences for PH, and the plants had a mean of
94.8cm (Gm9 Hap24a), 89.9cm (Gm9_Hap24b) and 87.5cm (Gm9 Hap24c) ofheight in Palo-
tina. The haplotypes together explained 12% ofthe phenotypic variation for PH (Table 5).

Discussion
GWAS and model selection
This study was undertaken to identify genomic regions associated with key complex traits in soy-
bean, using a genome-wide association approach. An advantage of using a genetically broad
panel is the opportunity to explore alleles that could potentially be usedin a marker-assisted
selection context to improve agronomic traits in soybean. In fact, this GWAS approach employed
the optimal mixed model identified valuable SNPS that were significantly associated with SY, SW
and PH. In addition, to refine the association with SNPs markers, a haplotype-based analysis was
performed to discover ifthese genomic regions werel localized at the same haplotype blocks, and
Williams 82 physical map. The soybean whole-genome sequence of fSoyBase [35] providedkey
insights about sequence-based genetic markers, previously reported as significant for these traits
in soybean.

Genetic relatedness (or kinship) and population structure are known as the major con-
founding factors that may lead to spurious associations in GWAS [29]. In consequence, we
tested allMLMs with the combination ofQ and K matrices. The Q + K model consistently fit
the best according to BICand -2logL, compared with either Q or K models. In addition, a
lower inflation ofP-values was consistently observed when Q + K models were employedin
data analyses. This analytical modelhas been recognized as an effective model to perform
genome-wide association for complex traits in many plant species [1, 2, 3], which has allowed
accurate analysis of association studies in soybean [4].
Correlation among traits
SY had a positive and significant correlation with SW, which is in agreement with previous
reports in soybean [1, 41]. The undefined correlation between SY and PH (significant positive

enzyme and Glyma19g196000 encodes a spindly-related enzyme. Bottom panel depicts haplotypes regions of 494 (Gm19_Hap42) and 163 kb

and negative values) observed in this study, has the same behavior as seen in previous studies
[42, 43]. According to Kim et al. [42] there is no consistent pattern in the relationship between
seed yield land other important agronomic traits in soybean, but it has been shown that a gen-
erally higher yield is associated with later maturity and taller plant height [43, 44, 45].
Haplotypes and genomic regions associated with complex traits
Many studies have demonstrated the power ofGWAS to detect significant QTL in soybean
populations. In this study, we highlight the importance ofhaving haplotype maps oftropical
soybean cultivars for marker-assisted selection (MAS). Moreover, according to Lorenz et al.
[7] GWAS may benefit from utilizing haplotype information for making marker-phenotype
associations and, in addition to the individual-SNP approach, offers further advantages for the
molecular genetic dissection ofloci underlying complex traits in soybean. Song et al. [3] stated
that with the adventofthe haplotype block map, one could efficiently select SNPS andhaplotypes
blocks for optimized association analysis. In this study, notably, the haplotype Gm12_Hap12
showed a significant positive association with both SY and SW. Furthermore, the positive signifi-
cant correlation between both traits may be a result of either genes in LD or genetic pleiotropy.
Given the high association offew likely putative genomic regions, we couldhypothesize that

AGenome-Wide Association Studyfor Key Complex Traits in Soybean
pleiotropic gene effects underlie the observed significant positive genotypic correlation between
these traits. However, the reverse is also true, i.e., several SY and SW QTLs were identified inde-
pendently (and localized on different genomic regions), evidencing the complexity ofthese traits.
The possibility of coexistence ofmultiple genes should not be excluded due to the quantitative
nature ofthe genetic background. Moreover, the sizes ofthe haplotype Gm12_Hap12 is greater
than 412 Kb. Additionally, SNP markers co-associated with two or more traits at the same haplo-
type coincided with significant phenotypic and genotypic correlation among the studied traits,
as reported before [1,45]. In soybean, MAS ofa co-associated genetic locus could simultaneously
improve multi-associated target traits, but additional studies are always necessary because the
distinction between LD and pleiotropy will allow breeders to develop effective breeding method-
ologies to select and obtain favorable trait combinations [41].
Yield QTLs identified on chromosome 12 are of particular interest because they showed
consistent effects across locations (Palotina, Primavera do Leste and Cascavel). Zhang et al. [5]
recently reported a close SNP (ss715613104) as effectively associated to SW in soybean. Fur-
thermore, the following SSR markers: satt568, satt442 and satt192, which are linked to seed
protein [36] and seed glycitein [37], respectively, have been co-localized near to the haplotype
block identified on chromosome 12. One ofthe primary advantages ofGWAS is the high map-
ping resolution. This feature enables GWAS to further narrow down the chromosomal region of
putative QTLS and predict causal genes [5]. Biologically important genes were identified on this
haplotype block region (Gm12_Hap12). The gene Glymal2g075700, which encodes a ribonucle-
ase III protein, represents an uncharacterized protein associated to BT097697 code in soybase
[46]. Glymal2g075600 is another gene located near to Gm12_Hap12, which encodes a protein
for senescence regulator in soybean (ie., annotated as a U-box domain-containing protein
13-like; Mhpewumspadsgwalmpurat, its homolog in Arabidopsis thaliana regulates the
expression of proteins associated with leaf senescence [47].
The SNP at 45 Mb on Chr19 associated with PHhas been previously reported by Lee et al.
[38] and Specht et al. [39], which has QTLs associated with Seed Yield 11-6, Plant height 4-2
and Plant Height 13-8. Zhang et al. [4] also reported this SNP, which was strongly associated
to PH and days to maturity. In fact, this result indicated that some causal gene(s) might exist
in this genomic region. These associated markers may be useful for aggregation of causal genes
ofinterest to improve soybean yield. Furthermore, in this region some markers have been
reported near to the Dtl gene (Glymal9g37890) [4]. Dtl is homologous to Arabidopsis termi-
nal flower 1, and plays a predominant role in determining stem growth habit in soybean [48].
Stem growth habit is an important discriminant trait for soybean cultivars classifying it in two
major categories, determinate and indeterminate. Given the high relationship between plant
growth habit, plant height and seed yieldin soybean, our result is highly consistent with the
result ofZhang et al. [4], who determined that the locus harboring Dtl was strongly associated
with PH.
Near to Dtl gene, in the same haplotype Gm19_Hap42, was located the SPINDLY gene
(SPY) (Glyma19g196000), which is considered to be a negative regulator of gibberellin (GA)
signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. Swain et al. [49] proposed that the SPY gene acts indepen-
dently ofGA responses in controlling cotyledon number, leafgrowth, hypocotylgrowth and
plant height. In our GWAS, this result makes sense because SPY was co-localized with genes of
plantheight and near to QTL controlling first flowering in soybean.
QTL X environment interaction
The significant G x E interaction explains the relatively low stability (or consistency) ofthe
identifiedloci. Moreover, this result is important, because clearly justifies the inclusion of

different environments (locations) in the GWAS. In fact, to obtain the real QTL with genetic
stability andhigh phenotypic variation explained, different environments ofthe same material,
QTL mapping and QTL geographic interactions should be used and explored [50]. Due to the
presence ofa significant G X E interaction, QTL analysis was separately carried out in each
location. In this study, most ofthe SNP-trait associations were location specific. When geno-
type or haplotype refers to QTL, this phenomenon is called QTL-by-environment interaction,
denoted by Q X E [51]. The existence ofQ X E reported here confirmed the complexity ofthe
quantitative traits under study.
Only three SNPS (ss715613203, ss715613104 and Ss715613207) and one haplotype
(Gm12_Hap12) were detectedto be stable for SY and SW with high correlation between
these two traitsin the four environments under consideration, which was due to that agro-
nomic traits are the result of the combined actions ofmultiple genes and environmental
factors; with gene expression varying across environments [52]. The inheritance of quanti-
tative traits undeniably involves multiple genes with small effect that are sensitive to envi-
ronmental changes [53]. The stable associations found in this study shouldbe useful for
the breeding purpose to find broad adaptability to different environments. In Brazil, the
development ofelite cultivars has long challenged breeders due to the effects oflarge differ-
ences in latitude, climate, altitude, diversity of soil type, farming and planting practices, plant
growth habit, presence or absence oflong-juvenile traits, different stress conditions and dis-
eases, resulting in large G X E interactions [54]. Thus, the marker-assisted selection using
markers identified in a specific environment could be beneficial for breeders that attemptto
identify the best landraces that are specifically adapted to local growing conditions.
In conclusion, with the aid ofthe haplotype block map constructed by Song et al. [3] and
our haplotype block results, we efficiently tested SNPs and SNP-based haplotypes for opti-
mized association analyses. Importantly, various haplotypes were significantly associated with
SY (11), SW (17) and PH (59), of which some were located in/or near regions where QTLs for
yield and yield-related traits have been previously mapped lby either linkage or GWAS analysis.
Moreover, new haplotypes-trait associations have been identified in this study (as the case of
Gm12_Hap12: Gm12_Hap12a and Gm12_Hap12b), which could be used as putative regions
for further research efforts focusing on the genetic basis of fsoybean yield and yield compo-
nents. These haplotypes showed the best performance in comparison with the Gm12_Hap12c
haplotype, and depended upon both geographic location and traits.
Some haplotypes contain SNP markers that were not detected in the single-marker analysis
(i.e., SY: Gm13_Hap36; SW: Gm7_Hap13 and Gm12_ Hap12; PH: Gm14_Hap21). This is
attributed to the nature ofthe haplotype-based method, which can better detect functional
haplotypes such as cis-interactions among multiple DNA variants in a haplotype block region
[55], and identify co-associated haplotype regions with two or more traits, indicating pleiot-
ropy of single causal gene or tight linkage ofmultiple causal genes [1], which is an advantage
ofthe haplotype analysis compared to the single SNP analysis. Another advantage ofthehaplo-
type-based method is that the small size ofthe haplotype regions (as identified in this study)
would facilitate the search for causal genetic variations that affect gene functions, as statedby
Abdel-Shafy et al. [8].
The use ofSNPs associated with quantitative trait loci under the allelic combination approach,
for example, can be further usedfor the efficient marker assisted selection of complex traits [34].
Moreover, the practical use ofthe haplotype identified in this study may contribute to increase
the efficiency ofthe current breeding programs carried out in tropical regions worldwide. The
results confirm that the haplotype-based GWAS provides new insights on the genetic determi-
nants that are not capturedby the single-SNP approach. However, as any molecular markers, we
emphasized that the identifiedhaplotypes should be validatedbefore large-scale use [56].

AGenome-Wide Association Studyfor Key Complex Traits in Soybean
Although SNP chips with higher density and next-generation sequencing may provide new
data [57], the results ofthis study suggest that BARCSOYSNP6K BeadChip is a valuable source
ofinformation to discover genomic regions that control quantitative traits. Finally, this research
identified useful haplotypes that have not been previously reported, which would help to assess
and validate causal genetic variation of fcomplex quantitative traits and eventually may be used
for breeding purposes in soybean.
