Abstract
Background: Seed flooding stress is one ofthe threatening environmental stressors that adversely limits soybean at
the germination stage across the globe. The knowledge on the genetic basis underlying seed-flooding tolerance is
limited. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 34,718 single nucleotide polymor-
phism (SNPS) in a panel of 243 worldwide soybean collections to identify genetic loci linked to soybean seed flooding
tolerance atthe germination stage.
Results: In the present study, GWAS was performed with two contrasting models, Mixed Linear Model (MLM) and
Multi-Locus Random-SNP-Effect Mixed Linear Model (mrMLM) to identify significant SNPS associated with electri-
cal conductivity (EC), germination rate (GR), shoot length (ShL), and root length (RL) traits at germination stage in
soybean. With MLM, a total of 20, 40, 4, and 9 SNPS associated with EC, GR, ShL and RL, respectively, whereas in the
same order mrMLM detected 27, 17, 13, and 18 SNPS. Among these SNPS, two major SNPS, Gm_08_11971416, and
Gm_08_46239716 were found to be consistently connected with seed-flooding tolerance related traits, namely EC
and GR across two environments. We also detected two SNPS, Gm_05_1000479 and Gm_01_53535790 linked to ShL
and RL, respectively. Based on Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, gene functional annotations, and protein-protein
interaction network analysis, we predicted eight candidate genes and three hub genes within the regions ofthe four
SNPS with Cis-elements in promoter regions which may be involved in seed-flooding tolerance in soybeans and these
warrant further screening and functional validation.
Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that GWAS based on high-density SNP markers is an efficient approach to
dissect the genetic basis of complex traits and lidentify candidate genes in soybean. The trait associated SNPS could
be used for genetic improvement in soybean breeding programs. The candidate genes couldhelp researchers better
understand the molecular mechanisms underlying seed-flooding stress tolerance in soybean.
