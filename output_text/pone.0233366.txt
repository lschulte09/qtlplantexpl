disease.
Partial resistance to soybean SSR is a heritable quantitative trait [6,7], which is controlled
by genes with main or minor effects and affected by environment and genotype by environ-
ment interactions [5]. Researchers have found that Sclerotinia scderotiorum-soybean molecular
interaction was a very complex process, involving many pathogen-released proteins [8] and
other factors, forinstance, oxalic acid, secreted effectors and cell wall degrading enzymes for
the host to deal with [9-13]. Pan et al (2018) identified that SsSml functioned as an elicitor
involved in hyphal development of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and silencing SsSml could reduce
the pathogenicity [14]. For the purpose offinding more functional genes, QTL analysis was
conducted, based on a linkage mapping strategy and the bi-parent population, to position
DNA markers associated with SSR resistance. At present, a total of103 QTLS, distributed on
18 ofall 20 soybean chromosomes, were reported in the Soybase databank (www.soybase.org).
Among these QTLS, most were not reported again in other studies. Therefore, these identified
QTLs were difficult to directly utilize in marker-asistedbreding (MAS) ofSSR. Different
from the bi-parent population oflinkage analysis, genome-wide association analysis (GWAS)
using a natural population ofnon-cross-derived lines could provide extensive recombination
and shorter LD segments and could thus increase the resolution ofmarker-phenotype associa-
tions [15].
Recently, high-throughput sequencing and gene chip technology have further accelerated
the development ofGWAS, and GWAS has been a promising strategy for the identification of
loci for genes ofinterest traits. Some studies have been reported for soybean SSR based on
GWAS andhighlighted its effectiveness aiming at improving the enhanced resistance to SSR.
Wei et al. (2017) used two models, CMLM and FarmCPU,and finally found 125 genes around
threel loci with high confidence [10]. Four QTNS, located on chromosome 01 (Chr.01), Chr.15,
Chr.19 and Chr.20, were detected through 130 testedsamples and 17,864 single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPS) based on the cotton pad method [16]. A total lof58 significant main effect
QTNS and 24 epistatic QTNS for the partial resistance ofSSR were finally identified on the
basis ofthe phenotypes of 466 diverse soybean accessions obtaining from the cut stem method,
and the genotyping data of35,683 SNPs [1]. Zhao et al. (2015) identified five genomic regions
that were significantly associated with stem pigmentation content after treatment with oxalo-
acetic acid, an indirect trait ofSSR resistance in soybean [5]. To date, soybean cultivars from
northeastern China have not evaluated SSR resistance based on the direct evaluation method.
In the present study, a total of 185 cultivars were evaluated for their partial resistance to
SSR using the detached leaf method, and GWAS was performed based on 22,048 SNPS and
these tested samples. The aim ofthis study was to screen resistance sources from Northeast
China, to identify QTN associated with partial resistance ofSSR, and to predict candidate
genes located in QTN regions.

Materials and methods
Plant materials and phenotypic evaluation
A total of 185 Chinese representative accessions, including 38 landraces and 147 elite cultivars,
were collected from northeastern China. Phenotypic evaluations ofthese tested accessions
were conducted using the 'detached leaf method' describedby Kull et al [17]. Five seeds of
each tested soybean were germinated in 15-cm clay pots containing an equal mixture of soil
(peat: soil: sand: vermiculite) and grown in a greenhouse (27 + 1'C) under 16-h day length
according to the detachedleafmethod describedby Kull et al [17]. And experimental designs
with a randomized complete block with three replications were utilized. The fully expanded
leaves of4-week-old soybeans were cut from the stem and then placed in a labeled, moistened
paper towel. An 8-mm? plug was placed fungus-side down centered on one side ofthe middle
trifoliolate leafbetween the main leafvein and the leaf edge and gently pressed to ensure good
contact with theleaf fsurface. After 48 h, the diameter oflesions among inoculatedleaves was
measured on the following 5days and used as the phenotypic value.
SNP genotyping data collection
The genomic DNA ofthe tested materials was isolated and then genotyped based on specific
locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) methodology [18]. Two digest enzymes, Mse
I (EC 3.1.21.4) and Haelll (EC: 3.1.21.4) (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA.),
were selected to produce more than 50,000 sequencing tags (approximately 300-500 bp in
length) of feach tested sample based on preliminary analysis ofthe reference genome, which
was distributed in unique genomic regions of20 soybean chromosomes. The sequencing
libraries of each tested sample were defined by sequencing tags with the same genomic region.
The barcode method with the Illumina Genome Analyzer II system (Illumina Inc., San Diego,
CA, USA) was used to generate reads measuring 45 bp in length at both ends of sequencing
tags from each accession library. The raw paired-end reads were aligned to the soybean refer-
ence genome using Short Oligonucleotide Alignment Program 2 (SOAP2) software. The raw
reads in the same genomic position were used to define the SLAF groups via more than 58,000
high-quality SLAF tags from each tested sample. The SNPs were defined based on
MAF > 0.05. The genotype was regarded as heterozygous when the depth of minor allelel the
total depth ofthe sample was N 1/3.
Among the 185 soybean accessions, we picked on twenty-six lines with extreme phenotypic
values for SSR, of which were thirteen resistant and thirteen susceptible lines, with a lower or
higher level on thelesion length, respectively. A genome resequencing with 10-fold in depth
was conducted using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer for the selected lines. Paired-end rese-
quencing reads were mapped to the soybean Williams 82 reference genome (Version: Glyma.
Wm82. a2) with BWA (Version: 0.6.1-r104) using the default parameters [19).SAMtools48
(Version: 0.1.18) software was used in converting mapping results into the BAM format and
filtering the unmapped and non-unique reads. Duplicated reads were filtered with the Picard
package (picardsourceforge.net. Version: 1.87). The BEDtools (Version: 2.17.0) coverage Bed
program was used for computing the coverage of sequence alignments. A sequence was
defined as absent when coverage was lower than 90% and present when coverage was higher
than 90%. SNP detection was conductedby the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, version 2.4-
7-g5e89f01) and SAMtools [19]. Only the SNPs that were detectedby both methods could be
further analyzed. The SNPs with allele frequencies lower than 5% in the population were dis-
carded. SNP annotations were performedbased on the soybean genome (Version:Glyma.
Wm82.a2) by the package ANNOVAR (Version: 2013-08-23) [19].

Population structure evaluation and linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis
The population structure ofthe association panel was analyzed through the principle compo-
nent analysis (PCA) approach ofGAPIT software [20]. LD between pairs of SNPS was defined
based on the SNP threshold value (MAF> 0.05 and missing data < 3%) and R? (squared allele
frequency correlations) using the software TASSEL version 3.0 [21].In contrast to the GWAS,
missing SNP genotypes were not imputed with the major allele before LD analysis. Parameters
in the program included MAF (> 0.05) and the integrity of each SNP (> 80%).
Association mapping
Compressed mixed linear model (CMLM) in GAPIT [20] and multi-locus random-SNP-effect
mixed linear model (mrMLM) were used to detect the association signals ofpartial resistance
to SSR with major or minor effects, respectively, through 22,048 SNPs and 185 tested acces-
sions. The significance thresholds for the association between SNP and traits were determined
by -log10(P) N 3 for CMLM model [22,23] and LODX 3for mrMLM model [24,25].
Prediction of candidate genes controlling resistance to SSR
Candidate genes, located in the 200-kb genomic region of each peak SNP, were classified and
then annotated with the soybean reference genome Williams 82 (Wm82. a2. vl, http://www.
soybase.org) according to Cheng et al [26]. The SNP variations that occurred lin the regions of
candidate genes, including exonic regions, splicing sites, 5'UTRs and 3'UTRS, intronic regions,
upstream and downstream regions, were detected based on genome re-sequencing data and
analyzed using the compressed mixed linear model (CMLM) method to identify SSR-related
haplotypes [21]. Significant SNPs affecting the target trait were claimed when the test statistics
reachedp < 0.01. Bio-Analytic Resource for Plant Biology database (BAR, http-//bar.utoronto.
calefp/og-binlefpweb.g) was used to further screen candidate genes for the resistance.
Results
Phenotypic characteristic of partial resistance to SSR in the association
panel
A wide range of resistance responses existed among the 185 samples after inoculation with
SSR (S1 Table). The mean coefficient ofvariation, skewness and kurtosis for the diameter of
lesions as the phenotype values among the whole association panel are shown in Table 1 and
Fig 1. The variation was observed, varying from 0.5 cm to 17.67 cm with an average value of
5.51 cm based on the data among the five tested time points. The coefficients ofvariation of
the association population under different time points ranged from 29.27% to 39.04%. No sig-
nificant skewness or kurtosis ofthe association panel was observed, which indicated that this
association panel was suitable for subsequent GWAS analysis.
Sequencing and SNP genotyping
The total DNA ofthe association panel containing 185 soybean accessions was partially
sequenced through a specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) approach. A
total of22,048 SNPS, distributed across all 20 chromosomes ofthe soybean genome, were iden-
tified with MAF > 5% and missing data < 3%. These developed SNPS spanned 917 Mbp,
which could cover approximately 83.36% ofthe soybean genome (Fig 2). The number of SNPs
was not even among the 20 chromosomes, with the highest andlowest number ofmarkers

The average marker density was approximately one SNP per 41.59 kb.
Genome-wide association of SSR partial resistance
The average distance ofLD decay was analyzed to describe the mapping resolution for GWAS.
The mean LD decay of fthe panel was estimated as 186.4 kb, when R2 decreased to halfofits
maximum value (Fig 3A). Principal component (PC) and kinship analyses were conductedto
scan the population stratification ofthe association panel with the 22,048 SNP markers. The
results showed that the first three PCs accounted for 13.18% ofthe overall genetic variations,
and the inflection point occurred at PC3, which indicated that the first three PCs could domi-
nate the population structure for the association mapping (Fig 3B and 3C). As shown in Fig
3D, alower level of genetic relatedness was exhibited from the distribution ofthe pairwise rela-
tive kinship coefficients among the 185 tested accessions. Based on the CMLM model, seven

major effects loci identified in atleast two tested time points were associated with partial resis-
tance to SSR, which were distributed on six chromosomes, including Chr.01, Chr.03, Chr.05,
Chr.06, Chr.12 and Chr.18 (S1 Fig and Table 2). Among these loci, one QTN, Gm06:39027181
located on Chr.06, was found in the linked genomic region ofthe known QTL "Sclero7-1'
between the SSR markers of Sat 238 and Sat_312 [27], and the other six QTNS were consid-
ered as the novel loci for partial resistance to SSR (Table 2). Additionally, nine novel SNPS
detected at least two time points were identified as the minor effects loci on the basisof
mrMLM model, which were distributed on eight different soybean chromosomes (Table 3).
One ofthe all the identified QTNS (Gm05:14834789 on Chr.05) was co-detected by both meth-
ods, giving more confidence that this locus might be significantly associated with soybean
defense to SSR partial disease. The alleles effects of all the identified resistance QTNS were fur-
ther analyzed, and the results showed that different alleles for each identified QTN could sig-
nificantly affect SSR partial resistance among all the tested samples (Tables 2 and 3). Thus,
these beneficial alleles would be valuable for MAS of soybean cultivars with excellent resistance
to SSR.
Prediction of candidate genes conferring partial resistance to SSR
Genes located within the 200-kb genomic region ofeach peak SNP identified by CMLM and
mrMLM were considered as candidates, and finally, 71 major and 85 minor effects genes were
found, respectively (S2 and S3 Tables). Some of these detected major genes have been identi-
fied to be ofkey importance in plant disease-related responses [28-32]. The research of

Jennifer Colburn-Clifford and Caitilyn Allen has indicated that a cbb3-type cytochrome C oxi-
dase could contribute to Ralstonia solanacearum race 3biovar 2 (R3bv2) resistance in tomato
[28].In the present study, Glyma.03G094400 (located 84.80 kb near Gm03:27991148 on
Chr.03) and Glyma.12G086600 (located 76.49 kb near Gm12:7079865 on Chr.12), containing
the same functional domain mentioned above, might be regarded as important factors in SSR
resistance to some extent. According to recent studies, Aubert et al [29]. and Gunupuru et al
[30]. have reported that a cytochrome P450 gene from the subfamily CYP72A and CYP94C,
respectively, conferred resistance to mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) from wheat and Botry-
tis cinerea from Arabidopsis. These two genes had domains identical to Glyma.06G238500 and
Glyma.12G087200, located near Gm06:39027181 on Chr.06 and Gm12:7079865 on Chr.12.
Additionally, Glyma.01G093400 (located 47.84 kb near Gm01:28271068 on Chr.01), a basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) DNA-binding superfamily protein, was of particular importance in
affecting the regulation of disease resistance in plants [31]. Glyma.18G013200 (located 16.91
kb near Gm18:949979 on Chr.18), amember ofmitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase
1, was shown to be a significant repressor in salicylic acid synthesis and made strong contribu-
tions to defense responses [32]. Moreover, three candidate genes with minor effects (Gly-
ma.07G007800, Glyma.07G007900 and Glyma.09G059700), contained the common disease
resistance proteins, including disease resistance protein (TIR-NBS-LRR class) and pathogene-
sis relatedhomeodomain protein of each own, were detected and recognized as potential
genes in soybean SSR responses.
To further determine the possibilities ofthe candidate genes affecting the partial resistance
to SSR, a gene-based association was conducted by the CMLM method among 13 resistant and
13 susceptible soybean lines (S2 Fig). Finally, a total of87 SNPs from 71 major candidate genes

and 102 SNPs from 85 minor candidate genes were identified on the basis ofgenome rese-
quencing (MAF > 0.05), respectively. Ofthem, six haplotypes obtained from three genes with
major effects (Glyma.18G012200, Glyma.18G013400 and Glyma.18G014200 located near
Gm18:949979 on Chr.18) out of71 candidates were found to be significantly associated with
partial resistance to SSR (Figs 4 and 6 and S4 Table). Among these three genes, Gly-
ma.18G012200, encoding a pectate lyase protein, has been reported as an essential effector in
Colletotrichum lindemuthianum (one ofthe most common and important genera of phyto-
pathogenic fungi) in plants [33]. The other two genes (Glyma.18G013400 and Gly-
ma.18G014200) couldbe considered novel genes conferring partial resistance to SSR.
Additionally, eight haplotypes derived from four novel genes with minor effects (Gly-
ma.09G059000, Glyma.16G106700, Glyma.18G071500 and Glyma.18G071700) out of85 candi-
dates were identified in relation to SSR partial resistance (Figs 5 and 7 and S5 Table). Given
the results ofthe allelic effects analysis on the two alleles of each peak SNP, the partial resis-
tance to SSR of soybean accessions with one allele was noticeable, unlike the other alleles
among these total seven candidates (Figs 6 and 7). Therefore, these beneficial alleles from the
candidate genes, exhibiting excellent partial resistance to SSR, may be interesting and helpful
for studies employing MAS in soybean. Moreover, the gene expression levels under biotic
stresses recorded on BAR database were applied in analyzing the potential resistances in fungal
diseases ofthe detected major or minor candidate genes (S3 and S4 Figs). Among them,
ATMG01360, AT3G55270, AT4G40080 and AT3G13330, which were homologous to Gly-
ma.03G094400, Glyma.18G013200 Glyma.18G014200 and Glyma.18G071500, exhibited a
higher expression after inoculating Botrytis cinereal and Phytophthora infestans (close relative
to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum) than the mock treatments, implying that these four candidates
might act as a positive regulator in controlling these two fungal diseases. On the contrary, the
expressions ofATIG67750, AT4G30020 and AT1G31410 homologous to Glyma.18G012200,
Glyma.09G059000 and Glyma.16G106700, were reduced after inoculating Botrytis cinereal and
Phytophthora infestans than that in the blank controlgroup, thus, Glyma.18G012200, Gly-
ma.09G059000 and Glyma.16G106700 were likely as negative regulatory factors in the disease
resistance. Besides, AT4G21105, AT3G26370, ATIG72890 and AT5G23810 (homologous to
Glyma.12G086600, Glyma.18G013400, Glyma.07G007900 and Glyma.18G071700) were
responded to Phytophthora infestans with the up-regulated or down-regulated gene expression
after treatments, and AT5G17680 (homologous to Glyma.07G007800) was responded to Botry-
tis cinereal with the highly upregulated expression.

Discussion
Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) is one ofthe most devastating fungal phytopathogens, causing severe
annual yieldlosses of soybean worldwide. As a heritable complex quantitative trait, SSR is con-
trolled by multiple genes with major or minor effects [6] and is easily affected by environment
and genotype through environment interactions [5]. Although no related research on com-
plete resistance to SSR has been reported in soybean, partial resistance was still an alternative
in effectively controlling SSR to a large extent [5]. Breeding resistant cultivars with durable
resistance genes/QTLs was still the most economical andlong-lasting means of managing this
disease. To date, more than a hundred QTLs on partial resistance to SSR have been reported
based on linkage mapping strategy and the bi-parent population (www.soybase.org). However,
few ofthese QTLs could be widely utilized in MAS for partial resistance to soybean SSR. In the
presentstudy, a group of 185 soybean accessions, including landraces or elite cultivars mainly
collected from China, was used to examine partial resistance to soybean SSR via GWAS based
on thehigh-throughout SNPS. The results showed that some ofthe tested samples exhibited a
higher level of partial resistance to SSR within a shorter lesion diameter during the dynamic
stages (Fig 1 and S1 Table). These accessions with partial resistance might be valuable
resources for soybean SSR resistance for breeding new varieties.

GWASfor partial resistance to SSR of soybean
In the present study, the data from the consecutive five days after inoculating detached
leaves for 48 h were not only used to screen resistant or susceptible soybean lines, but also
applied to observe the differences ofSSR spreading speed, and thereby, to find the SSR-related
resistance loci and genes. Finally, a total of 60 QTNS with major effects (under 3dpi, 7 QTNS;
under 4dpi, 22 QTNS; under 5dpi, 16 QTNS; under 6dpi, 9 QTNS; under 7dpi, 6 QTNS) were
positionedamong the five tested time points associated with partial resistance to soybean SSR
by GWAS based on the CMLM model (S1 Fig). Further, seven major QTNS, which were stably
detected under at least two time points, were considered to be the more significant ones.
Among them, Gm06:39027181 on Chr.06, identified under 5d and 6d', was found to overlap
with the known resistance QTL, known as "Sclero7-1', detected between the SSR markers
"Sat_238' and "Satt_312' by using the cross population with 180 F4 RILS derived from a cross
between Maple Donovan (a partially resistant cultivar) and OAC Bayfield (a susceptible culti-
var) [27]. The other six identified QTNS, including Gm01:28271068 under 4dpi and 6dpi,
Gm03:27991148 under 4dpi and 5dpi, Gm 05:14834789 under 5dpi, 6dpi and 7dpi,
Gm12:7079865 under 6dpi and 7dpi, Gm12:36426007 under 5dpi and 6dpi, and Gm18:949979
under 5dpi, 6dpi and 7dpi, weremarked as novel loci with strong possibilities in controlling
partial resistance ofsoybean SSR. Additionally, for effectively detecting the loci with minor
effects, a GWAS based on the mrMLM model was conducted, and nine novel QTNS detected
at least two time points were identified and regarded as the minor effects loci associated with
SSR partial resistance. Gm05:14834789 on Chr.05 was co-locatedby both models, giving more
possibilities that this locus might be a stable one in association with the defense to soybean
SSR partial disease.
To date, few genes associated with partial resistance ofSSR have been found or cloned.
Zhao et al. identifiedfour genes that were involved in disease response or the anthocyanin bio-
synthesis pathway using GWAS and linkage maps [5]. GWAS has been an effective method to
identify candidate genes for SSR partial resistance, especially with a relatively lower LD block.
In this study, a total of 71 and 85 potential candidate genes with major or minor effects were
selected on the basis ofthe seven and nine association signals via CMLM and mrMLM, respec-
tively. Ofthese candidate genes, Glyma.01G093400 (located near Gm01:28271068 on Chr.01),
Glyma.03G094400 (locatednear Gm03:27991148 on Chr.03), Glyma.06G238500 (located near
Gm06:39027181 on Chr.06), Glyma.12G086600 and Glyma.12G087200 (located near
Gm12:7079865 on Chr.12), and Glyma.18G013200 (located near Gm18:949979 on Chr.18)
have been demonstrated to be typical offactors participating in plant disease-related responses
[28-32]. Furthermore, combination with the data from theArabidopsis BAR database, we
found six major effects genes (Glyma.03G094400, Glyma.12G086600, Glyma.18G012200, Gly-
ma.18G013200, Glyma.18G013400 and Glyma.18G014200) and six minor effects genes (Gly-
ma.07G007800, Glyma.07G007900, Glyma.09G059000, Glyma.16G106700 Glyma.18G071500
and Glyma.18G071700) might responded to the fungal stress. To further determine the possi-
bilities ofthe candidate genes affecting the partial resistance to SSR, a gene-based association
was performed. Finally, three major genes with six beneficial haplotypes (Glyma.18G012200, 2
SNPS; Glyma.18G013400, 2 SNPS; and Glyma.18G014200, 2 SNPS) and four minor genes with
eight beneficial haplotypes (Glyma.09G059000, 2 SNPS; Glyma.16G106700, 2 SNPs Gly-
ma.18G071500, 2 SNPS and Glyma.18G071700, 2 SNPS) were screened. Ofthese genes, Gly-
ma.18G012200, belonging to the pectate lyase superfamily protein, has been identified as a key
effector in controlling Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, recognized as one ofthe most com-
mon and important genera of fphytopathogenic fungi, in plants [33]. The other six genes, each
containing two allelic variations occurring in major regions, may also have potential for man-
aging partial resistance to soybean SSR. Moreover, a possibility ofinteraction between the Gly-
ma.09G059000 and Glyma.18G071500 was existed recorded on the STRING database (https:ll
