resistance variation data observed in the field and greenhouse environments, genome-wide
association studies (GWASS) were conducted to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling
resistance against white mould. Results showed that 16 and 11 loci were found significantly
associated with resistance in field and greenhouse, respectively. Of these, eight loci localized
to previously mapped QTL intervals and one locus had significant associations with resistance
across both environments. The expression level changes in genes located in GWAS-identified
loci were assessed between partially resistant and susceptible genotypes through a RNA-seq
analysis of the stem tissue collected at various time points after inoculation. A set of genes
with diverse biological functionalities were identified as strong candidates underlying white
mould resistance. Moreover, we found that genomic prediction models outperformed
predictions based on significant SNPS. Prediction accuracies ranged from 0.48 to 0.64 for
