Abstract: The depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer is a major environmental issue and has
increased the dosage of ultraviolet-B(UV-B) radiation reaching the Earth'ssurface. Organisms are
negatively affected by enhancedUV-B radiation, and especially in crop plants this may lead to severe

yield losses. Soybean (Glycine max L.), a major legume crop, is sensitive to UV-B radiation, and

an ozone-depleting gas not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, was observed to be increas-
ing rapidly in the atmosphere, becoming another threat to stratospheric ozone [1,2]. These
unexpected factors have been delaying a full recovery of the ozone to pre-1970 levels, and the
resulting UV light elevation continuously harms life on Earth.
Solar UV radiation is subdivided into three types: UV-A (315-400 nm), UV-B (280-
320 nm), and UV-C (200-280 nm). The stratospheric ozone layer absorbs UV-B radiation,
but with the depletion causedby ODSs, high levels ofUV-B radiation can reach the ground
through the ozone hole. Under the enhanced UV-B conditions, plants are negatively
affected, with their membranes, proteins, and DNA showing biological and physiologi-
cal changes associated with photomorphogenesis [3], along with a reduction in biomass
accumulation [4]. In plants, the responses to UV-B are related to several biological mecha-
nisms, such as the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDS) and pyrimidine-
pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts [5,6], inactivation of photosynthesis [71, downregulation
of phytohormones [8], secondary metabolism [91, and free-radical scavenging [10]. CPD,
the most abundant DNA damage induced by UV-B, inhibits transcription and replication,
leading to mutagenesis in plants [11,12]. The UV-B-induced CPDs are repairedby mecha-
nisms including nucleotide excision repair (NER) and photoreactivation [13-15]. The other
mechanism can be activatedby UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8) homodimers [16]. This
UV-B-specific photoreceptor interacts with CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENICI
(COP1) and regulates the gene expression response to UV-B acclimation. Recent studies
revealed that UV-induced responses such as changes in phytohormone and metabolite
levels also depend on UVR8 [8,17,18].
Soybean is considered a UV-B-sensitive plant. Enhanced UV-B turns the soybean
plants into dwarf type by shortening the internode length [19]. Feng, An [20] indicated
that soybean under UV-B enhanced conditions showed changes in flowering time and
decreases in chlorophyll a/b contents, total leaf number, and total leaf area. Moreover,
decreases in total biomass and yield components such as seed size and weight and reduc-
tions in concentrations of phenolic compounds and isoflavones were observed in soybean
plants when exposed to elevated UV-B radiation [7,21,22]. Recent studies in soybean have
investigated the underlying genes and variations controlling these responses to UV-B light.
Several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with UV-B resistance were identified using
the F11 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of Keunol (UV-B susceptible) X Iksan 10
(UV-B-resistant; derived from Bangsa by irradiation breeding) [23]. In a study with the
F12 RIL population of Keunol X Iksan 10, positional mapping of a QTL on chromosome
7 identified RAD23, a homolog of yeast RAD23, as one of the candidate genes for UV-B
resistance [24]. In yeast, RAD23 was previously reported as a UV excision repair protein,
suggesting a similar function regarding UV-B resistance in soybean. In another study, a
genome-wide comparison between UV-B-resistant IT162669 and UV-B-sensitive Cheongja
3 identified four genes related to plant protection including UV-B resistance [25]. Further-
more, using an F6 RIL population of Cheongja 3 X Buseok, four UV-B resistance QTLs were
identified, and among those QTLS, a gene with two non-synonymous SNPs differentiating
the parental lines, was identified on chromosome 6 [26].
Genome-wide association studies (GWASS) are a powerful approach that provides
higher resolution than linkage mapping because they utilize the historical recombination
events of a natural population [27]. Numerous GWASS have been conducted in soybean to
identify putative genes and QTLs associated with agronomic traits such as branching [28],
plant height [29], photosynthesis [30], resistance to insect pests [31], and soybean mosaic
virus [32]. This was made possible by the availability ofhigh-throughput SNP genotyping
systems such as Golden Gate assay [33], SoySNP50K array [34], and Axiome Soya 180K
SNP array [35]. Nevertheless, for UV-B resistance genes and QTLS, a GWAS has not
yet been conducted on a soybean germplasm collection. In this study, we performed a
GWAS for a total of 688 soybean germplasms and identified eight genes associated with
UV-B resistance. Furthermore, we compared the expression level of two candidate genes
using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) between UV-B-resistant (GCS731) and

susceptible (Daepung [35]) genotypes, showing significantly higher expressions in the
UV-B-resistant genotype.
2. Results
2.1. Phenotypic Evaluation of Soybean Germplasm Collection under Enhanced uV-B Conditions
A total of 688 soybean germplasms were evaluated under UV-B enhanced conditions
for two different phenotypic change responses to UV-B light: Damage of Leaf Chlorosis
(DLC) and Damage of Leaf Shape (DLS) (Table S1). The phenotypic distribution of DLS
showed a similar pattern to the normal distribution (Figure 1). Seventy-two (10.5%) and
59 (8.6%) accessions were scored as grade 1 for DLC and DLS, respectively, and 36 (5.2%)
accessions were scored as grade 1 for both DLC and DLS. Among these 36 accessions,
GCS731 (IT025231) showed the most resistant phenotype.

2.2. Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)
Principal component analysis (PCA) and kinship analyses were conducted for popu-
lation structure analysis using 65,762 high-quality SNPs with a compressed mixed linear
model (CMLM). The variation of the first 10 principal components (PCs) showed an inflec-
tion point at PC2, suggesting that the first two PCs dominated the population structure on
the association mapping (Figure 2A,B). Weak genetic relatedness of the population was
observed from the distribution of the coefficients from kinship analysis among the 688
germplasms (Figure 2C). To identify SNPs associated with the UV-B-induced traits DLC
and DLS, a GWAS was conducted for the 688 soybean germplasms using GAPIT [36]. The
observed p-values of MLM followed the expected p-values of that for both DLC and DLS
as shown in quantile- quantile plots (QQ plots), indicating that there is little chance of false
positives due to the population structure (Figure 3). A total of five peaks were significantly
associated with DLC and DLS with a p-value (FDR-unadjusted) threshold of 0.0001 (Table
S2). No SNP was found at FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05 due to high stringency [37]. For
association with DLC, a single peak on chromosome 10 and two peaks on chromosome 11
were identified. AX-90454793 on chromosome 10 and AX-90522955 and AX-90521132 on
chromosome 11 were significantly associated with DLC with -log(p) == 4.06, 4.38 and 5.19,
respectively. For association with DLS, single peaks were identified on both chromosomes
2 and 6. AX-90334094 on chromosome 2 and AX-90333167 on chromosome 6 were signifi-
cantly associated with DLS with -log(p) = 4.34 and 4.29, respectively. In total, five SNPS
(chromosomes 2, 6, 10, and 11) were significantly associated with UV-B resistance traits,
DLC and DLS (Table S2).

2.3. Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Analysis
The ranges of LDI blocks that contain significant SNPS were estimated to narrow down
the candidate genes nearby. For DLC, three peaks on chromosomes 10 and 11 represented
by AX-90454793, AX-90522955, and AX-90521132 were examined (Table 1). AX-90454793
on chromosome 10 was found inside an LD block 292 bp in size with a gene not associated
with UV-B resistance (Figure S1). A 19,194 bp-long LD block carrying AX-90522955 on
chromosome 11 also contained 18 genes not related to UV-B resistance (Figure S2), while
AX-90521132 was located within another LD block on chromosome 11 that was 24,174bp
in length with eight genes including Glyma.11g130800, which encodes the WD40 domain
(Figure S3). For DLS, LD blocks comprising the peaks on chromosomes 2 and 6 were
determined. AX-90334094 on chromosome 2 was located inside an LD block spanning
29,095bp withnine genes (Figure 4A-C), while the LD block on chromosome 6 carrying
AX-90333167 was 798,909 bp in size with 94 genes including Glyma.06g103200, which
encodes CRY1 (Figure 4D-F).

For each gene within these LD blocks, gene descriptions suggesting their potential
functions were obtained from SoyBase and carefully curated to select genes that have
functions related to UV-B resistance. We selected a total of five putative genes related toUV-
B perception and resistance mechanisms such as WD40 domain, auxin-related protein, and
photolyase (Table 2). Most interestingly, Glyma.02017500 and Glyma.06g103200 encoding
cryptochromes are reported to have a similar structure to photolyase, which plays a role in
repairing UV-B damaged DNA by photoreactivation [38].

2.4. Gene Expression Analysis by qRT-PCR
Expression levels of the candidate genes were measured using qRT-PCR to identify
UV-B-induced changes in gene expression under UV-B enhanced conditions. UV-B-resistant
(GCS731) and susceptible (Daepung) soybean plants were treated with supplementary
UV-B radiation for three different durations (0, 1, and 6 h) with three replicates. Total RNA
was isolated from trifoliate leaves of the two genotypes, and qRT-PCR was conducted
for two candidate genes, Glyma.06g103200 (CRY1) and Glyma.06g095400 (AFB5). For both
genes, the expression levels were higher in UV-B-resistant GCS731 than UV-B susceptible
Daepung throughout all three UV-B conditions (Figure 5A,B). Gly-ma.06g103200 (CRY1)
was expressed more after being exposed to enhanced UV-B radiation for 1 h, and then
its expression decreased at 6 h of irradiation for both resistant and susceptible genotypes
(Figure 5A). Interestingly, a statistically significant and nearly three-fold difference was
observed between GCS731 and Daepung after 61 h ofUV-B irradiation (Figure 5A). On the
other hand, the expression levels of Glyma.06g095400 (AFB5) remained downregulated
when exposed to supplementary UV-B radiation regardless of the duration (Figure 5B).
However, the difference between the two genotypes was not statistically significant.

3. Discussion
In this study, a total of 688 soybean germplasms from diverse genetic backgrounds
were evaluated for their responses to enhanced UV-B radiation. Evaluated by two distinct
phenotypic criteria based on changes in leafchlorosis (DLC) and shape (DLS), we identified
36 accessions (5.2% of total germplasms) showing strong UV-B resistance with DLC and
DLS scores of 1 (most resistant). For both DLC and DLS, the distributions of phenotype
scores were close to a normal distribution and showed transgressive segregation. These
results indicate that DLC and DLS are quantitative traits governed by polygenes. The
plant has many direct and indirect effects from UV-B radiation such as damage to DNA,
proteins, and membranes [39]. Thus, resistance to UV-B radiation is strongly related to
various mechanisms involving DNA repair, perception of UV-B radiation, and removal of
oxidative stress.
Based on the GWAS results, we selected a total of five genes involved in response
mechanisms to UV-B radiation. Among these genes, Glyma.11g130800 and Glyma.06g097800
encode the WD40 domain, which plays an essential role in UV-B resistance. The WD40
domain is one of the most abundant domains that function as platforms for protein-protein
interactions and are involved in numerous biological processes including DNA damage
and repair [40]. COP1 carries the WD40 domain and interacts with UVR8, the specific UV-B
receptor. Moreover, RUP1 and RUP2 are members of the WD40 repeat protein family and
interrupt the interaction between UVR8-COP1 [41]. Interestingly, many protein-containing
"WDxR" motifs in their WD40repeat regions enhance the repair of damaged DNAS as seen
in Cockayne syndrome A (CSA) [42], damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1)[43], and
WRAP53 beta [44].
Auxin is a plant hormone that promotes cell elongation. Plants may bend their
shoots and roots in response to UV-B radiation by managing plant hormones [45,46],
and several studies havereported that UV-B radiation inhibits auxin biosynthesis [17,47].
Glyma.06g095400 encodes Auxin F-box protein 5 (AFB5), and AFB5 is known as an auxin
receptor that plays a role in mediating the leaf cell expansion and division by auxin [48,49].
The regulation of auxin is linked to the transcription factors central to UV-B signaling. For
example, HY5, a transcription factor of auxin signaling and transportation, is an essential
factor for UV-B perception signaling [46,50,51]. Therefore, Glyma.06g095400 might be
involved in UV-B signaling regulating auxin in soybean.
Glyma.02g017500 and Glyma.06g103200 encode cryptochrome (CRY) and cryptochrome
1 (CRY1) in soybean, respectively. Cryptochrome is a flavoprotein photoreceptor that
senses blue light to regulate plant development and circadian clock [52]. The structure
of cryptochrome is similar to that of the photoreactivation enzyme, which is considered



Plants 2021, 10, 1335
10of15
an ancient photolyase [38]. Photolyase is also a flavoprotein that has a role in eliminating
UV-induced CPDs in DNA during photoreactivation [13,38,52]. Photoreactivation was
described lin 1949 as a DNA repair mechanism through which photodimers are removed by
binding of photolyase to the damaged region [53]. Although cryptochrome is considered
a protein that reduces DNA repair activity and has a novel function in signaling, several
studies have shown that cryptochrome still acts as a DNA repair enzyme [54]. DNA repair
is well known as a key process to overcome UV-induced damage. Thus, Glyma.02g017500
and Glyma.06g103200 could be important enzymes that promote UV-B resistance in soybean.
Similarly, an orthologous gene of RAD23reported as an NER-related gene has been reported
as a gene associated with UV resistance in soybean [24].
For Glyma.06g103200 (CRY1) and Glyma.06g095400 (AFB5), the gene expression levels
between UV-B-resistant and susceptible soybeans were compared using qRT-PCR. CRY1
showed higher expression in a resistant soybean (GCS731) throughout the different ir-
radiation times. In addition, the expression levels after 1 and 6 h of UV-B irradiation
showed significant differences between the two genotypes, suggesting an induced ex-
pression of CRY1 in the resistant genotype. Furthermore, Auxin F-box 5 (AFB5) in both
soybean varieties showed further downregulation as UV-B was irradiated for a longer
time. In the resistant genotype, AFB5 was expressed higher compared to the susceptible
genotype; however, the difference was not statistically significant. This might be because
the auxin hormone is commonly spread out in plants for growth and development as well
as UV-induced response [48].
In this study, we selected genetic resources, including GCS731, which showed the
strongest UV-B resistance among 688 soybean germplasms. These resources can be in-
corporated into a breeding program to develop soybean varieties resistant to enhanced
UV-B radiation. Due to global warming, crop cultivation may expand to higher latitude
to avoid pests and diseases that become more severe in warm environments. Moreover,
warmer temperature stimulates the depletion of the ozone layer, resulting in elevated UV-B
radiation throughout crop cultivation. Therefore, UV-B-resistant varieties can be cultivated
at higher latitude under elevated UV-B radiation without any loss of production.
As most plants produce energy from solar radiation, they evolved to tolerate UV-B
radiation throughout the entire life cycle. However, not much has been reported about UV-
B resistance in soybean, while numerous studies have covered various aspects of resistance
mechanisms in the model plant Arabidopsis. This study is the first to report a GWAS
analysis conducted with a large set of soybean germplasms. We identified five significant
peaks covering five genes with their potential functions related to UV-B responses. Further
investigation of these candidate genes of UV-B resistance would give us insights into how
the resistant soybean responds to enhanced UV-B radiation. Furthermore, evaluating
soybean transplants overexpressing the candidate genes would validate the exact function
of these genes under high intensity of UV-B radiation.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Plant Materials and Growth Conditions
A collection of a total of 688 soybean germplasms consisting of 620 landraces, 33
breeding lines, 29 varieties, and 6 accessions with unknown origin were obtained from
the National Institute of Crop Science in the Rural Development Administration (RDA,
Wanju, Korea) (Table S1). In the collection, 620 accessions were from South Korea, and 12,
9, 4, and 1 accessions were from the USA, Japan, China, and North Korea, respectively.
Soybean plants were cultivated in a growth chamber and an experimental greenhouse at
Dankook University, Cheonan, Korea. With Daepung [35] (UV-B susceptible) and GCS731
(UV-B-resistant) as control plants, each accession was planted in 27 cm wide X 53 cm long
trays with 50 holes filled with synthetic cultivation soil and organized in a completely
randomized design with three replicates.

4.2. Evaluation of uV-B Resistance
Evaluation of UV-B resistance under enhanced UV-B radiation was conducted accord-
ing to a previous study with minor modifications [23,24]. Artificial irradiation systems
using UV-B lamps (TL 20W/01 RS 312 nm UV-B narrowband lamp, Philips) were installed
in the growth chamber and the greenhouse at Dankook University, Cheonan, Korea. The
soybean plants were transferred to the UV-B irradiation system and irradiated at the V2
stage for 6h per day (10:00-16:00) for 14 days. For uniform UV-B intensity of 3.0-3.5 Wm -2 1
the distances from the UV-B lamps to the tops of the plants were maintained between 20
and 30 cm [24]. The UV-B intensity was checked repeatedly using a UV-radiometer (DO
9847, Delta OHM) with an LP 471 UV-B sensor. After 14 days of irradiation, the levels of
leaf damage due to supplemental UV-B light were measured. The degree of leaf chlorosis
(DLC) and the degree of leaf shape change (DLS) were determined with scores from 1
to 9 by comparing the phenotypes with control plants within each tray ("1" for 0-10%
damage, "3" for 10-30% damage, "5" for 30-50% damage, "7" for 50-70% damage, and "g"
for 70-90% damage) (Figure 6). To minimize phenotyping errors, soybean accessions with
each measurement below three on average (DLC < 3 or DLS < 3) were tested twice with
three replicates per accession.

4.3. Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)
For population structure analysis, PCA and kinship plots were generated using the
genome association and prediction integrated tool (GAPIT) package in the R program [55]
and a heat map of kinship matrix was created using the VanRaden kinship algorithm [56].
SNP genotyping data of soybean germplasms generated using 180K Axiome Soya SNP
array [35] were obtained from the National Institute of Crop Science in the Rural Devel-
opment Administration (RDA, Wanju, Korea). SNPS with a minor allele frequency under
5% (MAF < 5%) were excluded to remove low-quality SNPS, which generated a final set of
65,762 high-quality SNPs for GWAS analysis. The GWAS was performed using GAPIT [55]
with defaultsettings. A mixed linear model (MLM), which generally outperforms a general
linear model (GLM) by adding random effects of SNPs, was used to analyze associations
between SNP genotypes and UV-B responses. The false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted



Plants 2021, 10, 1335
12of15
p-values from GAPIT were found to be very stringent because the marker effects could have
been overcorrecting based on both population structure Q and kinship K [57,58]. Therefore,
an FDR-unadjusted p-value of0.0001 was used as the threshold to identify significant SNPs
for UV-B resistance.
4.4. Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Analysis and Candidate Gene Identification
LD analysis was performed using PLINK software with an LD window lengthof 1 Mb
and an unlimited number of variants within the LD window (-12-ld-window-kb 1000 -ld-
window 99999) [28,59]. LD blocks containing significant SNPs were searched using the
genome browser at Phytozome (https:/ /phytozomeigidoe.gov /jbrowse/,accessed on
21 June 2021) to narrow down candidate genes responsible for UV-B resistance. Functional
descriptions of candidate genes were obtained from the SoyBase website (https://soybase.
on/82/ghowe/.acesed on 21 June 2021) [60].
4.5. Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR
For RNA extraction, a resistance soybean GCS731 and a susceptible soybean Daepung
were irradiated by UV-B at the V2 stage with three replicates. Fully expanded trifoliate
leaves were harvested from each plant according to the irradiation time: 0,1,6h[61]. The
harvested leaves were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and ground into a powder
withbeadsi in a2mLtube. Total RNA was isolated from the groundleaves using the RNeasy
Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The quantity of total RNA was estimated using Nanodrop, and 1 ug
of total RNA was used for reverse transcription. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using
CDNA EcoDry Premix (TaKaRa, Clontech, Cellartis).
Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed on an ABI
7500 real-time PCR machine with 2x QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Biosystems,
Germantown, MD, USA). The primers of genes were designed based on CDS sequences
obtained at Phytozome. To minimize amplification error due to DNA contamination,
primers sets were designed from exon-exonjunctions. The amount ofcDNA was normalized
to the B-ACTIN reference gene [62]. Two replicate reactions were performed for each
sample, and the 2 AACT method [63] was used to convert the Ct value (quantification
cycles) into the relative quantities. The amplification conditions were as follows: 95 °C for
5 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 5 S, 60 C for 10 S, and 95 C for 15 S. The melting
temperature was 60 C for 1 min.
5. Conclusions
In this study, we identified UV-B-resistant soybeans by evaluating the phenotypic
changes of 688 soybean germplasms under UV-B enhanced conditions. We conducted
a GWAS analysis for UV-B resistance, which is first to report on soybean, resulting in
five significant peaks that narrowed into five candidate genes related to UV-B responses.
Among these genes, CRY and CRY1 were the most presumed genes for UV-B resistance
due to their function associated with the DNA repair process. Cryptochrome protein is
structurally similar to photolyase, which repairs damaged DNA in a photoreactivation
process. Furthermore, the expression level of CRY1 was statistically significantly higher
in resistance soybean GCS731 compared to susceptible soybean Daepung. SNP markers
AX-90334094 and AX-90333167 with the candidate genes CRY and CRY1 couldbe usedin
marker-assisted selection when breeding UV-B-resistant soybean.
