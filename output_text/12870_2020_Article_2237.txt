Abstract
Background: Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for plant growth and development. Iron deficiency chlorosis
(IDC), caused by calcareous soils or high soil pH, can limit iron availability, negatively affecting soybean (Glycine
max) yield. This study leverages genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a genome-wide epistatic study (GWES)
with previous gene expression studies to identify regions of the soybean genome important in iron deficiency
tolerance.
Results: A GWAS and a GWES were performed using 460 diverse soybean PI lines from 27 countries, in field and
hydroponic iron stress conditions, using more than 36,000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers.
Combining this approach with available RNA-sequencing data identified significant markers, genomic regions, and
novel genes associated with or responding to iron deficiency. Sixty-nine genomic regions associated with IDC
tolerance were identified across 19 chromosomes via the GWAS, including the major-effect quantitative trait locus
(QTL) on chromosome Gm03. Cluster analysis of significant SNPS in this region deconstructed this historically
prominent QTL into four distinct linkage blocks, enabling the identification of multiple candidate genes for iron
chlorosis tolerance. The complementary GWES identified SNPS in this region interacting with nine other genomic
regions, providing the first evidence of epistatic interactions impacting iron deficiency tolerance.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that integrating cutting edge genome wide association (GWA), genome
wide epistasis (GWE), and gene expression studies is a powerful strategy to identify novel iron tolerance QTL and
candidate loci from diverse germplasm. Crops, unlike model species, have undergone selection for thousands of
years, constraining and/or enhancing stress responses. Leveraging genomics-enabled approaches to study these
adaptations is essential for future crop improvement.
