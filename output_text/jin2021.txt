important to exploit the gene pool of wild soybean. In this study, we identified 34 salt-tolerant
accessions from wild soybean germplasm and found that a 7-bp insertion/deletion (InDel) in the
promoter of GSERD15B (early responsive to dehydration 15B) significantly affects the salt
tolerance of soybean. GSERD15B encodes a protein with transcriptional activation function and
contains al PAM2 domain to mediate its interaction with poly(A)-binding (PAB) proteins. The 7-bp
deletion in GSERD15B promoter enhanced the salt tolerance of soybean, with increased up-
regulation of GSERD15B, two GmPAB genes, the known stress-related genes including GmABI1,
GmABI2, GmbZIP1, GmP5CS, GmCAT4, GmPIP1:6, GmMYB84 and GmSOS1 in response to salt
stress. We propose that natural variation in GSERD15B promoter affects soybean salt tolerance,
