A genome-wide association study of
seed composition traits in wild soybean
(Glycine soja)

Abstract
Background: Cultivated soybean (Glycine max) is a major agricultural crop that provides a crucial source of edible
protein and oil Decreased amounts of saturated palmitic acid and increased amounts of unsaturated oleic acid in
soybean oil are considered optimal for human cardiovascular health and therefore there has considerable interest
by breeders in discovering genes affecting the relative concentrations of these fatty acids. Using a genome-wide
association (GWA) approach with nearly 30,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS), we investigated the
genetic basis of protein, oil and all five fatty acid levels in seeds from a sample of 570 wild soybeans
(Glycine soja), the progenitor of domesticated soybean, to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLS) affecting
these seed composition traits.
Results: We discovered 29 SNPS located on ten different chromosomes that are significantly associated with
the seven seed composition traits in our wild soybean sample. Eight SNPS co-localized with QTLS previously
uncovered in linkage or association mapping studies conducted with cultivated soybean samples, while the
remaining SNPS appeared to be in novel locations. Twenty-four of the SNPS significantly associated with fatty
acid variation, with the majority located on chromosomes 14 (6 SNPS) and seven (8 SNPS). Two SNPS were
common for two or more fatty acids, suggesting loci with pleiotropic effects. We also identified some
candidate genes that are involved in fatty acid metabolism and regulation. For each of the seven traits, most
of the SNPS produced differences between the average phenotypic values of the two homozygotes of about
one-half standard deviation and contributed over 3% of their total variability.
Conclusions: This is the first GWA study conducted on seed composition traits solely in wild soybean
populations, and a number of QTLS were found that have not been previously discovered. Some of these
may be useful to breeders who select for increased protein/oil content or altered fatty acid ratios in the
seeds. The results also provide additional insight into the genetic architecture of these traits in a large sample
of wild soybean, and suggest some new candidate genes whose molecular effects on these traits need to be
further studied.
