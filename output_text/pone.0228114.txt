drought tolerance [9], disease resistance [10, 11], plant height [12, 13],leaf architecture [14,
15], and seed weight [16, 17]. The knowledge ofthe trait-related SNP markers has served as
the genetic basis for the improvement ofvarious traits in crop breeding programs [18].
Days to flowering (DTF) is a crucial agronomic trait that regulates the maximum use of
sunlight and temperature [19], and affects the growth and yield potentials [20]. Many GWAS
on singlewariantaditivefedt thus have carried out to improve yield productivity, and have
led to identify DTF markers in many crops. For example, three candidate genes including
Nsnl, Fpa, and Zmm22 were identified in 942 maize samples (Zea mays) [21]; two candidate
genes, CO1 and BFL, were identified lin using 218 barley samples (Hordeum vulgare) [22];
eight candidate genes including Hdl were confirmed in 950 rice samples (Oryza sativa) [23];
and ten candidate genes including SOC1,AGL6, and ELF8 were reported in 309 soybean sam-
ples (Glycine max) [13]. These findings have presented valuable information to various breed-
ing programs focused on DTF, but have a limitation to further improve DTF, because they are
not sufficient for explaining all ofthe phenotypic variations in DTF such as interaction effects
between markers [24].
Epistasis is defined as the interaction between genes or SNP markers that influences a trait
[25]. Each SNP marker above a significant level in GWAS has a strong effect on the determina-
tion ofa trait, butnon-significant markers that interact with each other could also have a large
influence on the trait [24]. Therefore, considering epistatic interactions for multi-variant non-
additive effects, enables to discover more markers associated with traits, together with GWAS
on singlewarintaditineficts [26]. For this reason, many GWAS studies have utilizedepi-
static analysis as a complementary approach, and have reported significant epistasis and
GWAS markers associated with various traits: 12 epistatic markers with 12 GWAS markers for
sudden death syndrome resistance in soybean [27], ten epistatic markers with 33 GWAS mark-
ers for iron deficiency-related chlorosis in soybean [28], nine epistatic markers with 14 GWAS
markers for seed weightin soybean [29], and 38 epistatic markers with 113 GWAS markers for
DTF in barley [30]. Significant markers controlling many traits have been investigated through
these studies; however, soybean's DTF markers related to both epistasis and GWAS have not
been investigated in depth as other traits.
Twelve major genes affecting DTF have been identified in soybean, including E1-E10 [31-
41],J[42], and Dtl [43, 44]. To better understand the DTF-related genetic factors beyond the
twelve major genes, an epistasis study with GWAS is needed. Here, we genotyped 2,662 culti-
vated soybean accessions using the high-density Axiom R 180k SoyaSNP array developed lby
our team in 2016 [45]. Also, we evaluated the DTF trait of all accessions through a phenotypic
survey. The aims ofthis study were: 1)to examine population structures ofthe 2,662 accessions
for GWAS; 2) to identify significant markers associated with DTF through GWAS; 3) to reveal
epistatic markers with interactions between significant and non-significant GWAS markers;
and 4) to present final candidate markers with the relation to major DTF pathways.
Materials and methods
Plant materials and genotyping
A total of2,872 soybean (Glycine max) accessions were collected from the National Agrobiodi-
versity Center in the Rural Development Administration (RDA, Jeonju, Korea), and were gen-
otyped using the Axiom R 180k SoyaSNP. Ofthese, 210 hybrid accessions were excludedfrom
the analysis. The remaining 2,662 accessions originated from South Korea (2,415), North

Korea (96), the USA (60), China (59), and Japan (32), and comprised 335improved cultivars
(ICs), 2,175 landraces (LRs), and 152 unknown cultivars (UCs) (S1 Dataset). These accessions
belonged to the following seven maturity groups: I (2), II (31), III (60),IV (187), V (88), VI
(16), and VII (3); however, the maturity group of most ofthe Korean accessions (2,275) was
not reported. After genotyping, 180,961 SNP markers were detected, and haplotype phasing
and imputation were conducted using BEAGLE version 3.3.1 [46]. Then, 78,427 SNP markers
with a minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.05 were obtained. The non-MAF filtered SNPS were
used to examine the genomic structure and relationship, and the MAF filtered SNPS were used
to perform the GWAS. The genotype data of all 2,662 accessions, which were generated in col-
laboration with the RDA, is available at http://k-crop.kr and htps.lgithub.com/
bpunp@hyounsopbeunu.gpitais [47]. Phenotypic evaluation was conducted in the experimen-
tal field ofthe National Institute ofCrop Science (NICS, Jeonju, Korea) (35*50'26.7" N, 127°
02'42.7" E), and the DTF trait was measured from June to October in 2014. Because ofan
agreement on limited disclosure with our phenotypic evaluation team, the raw DTF values are
provided in the distribution plot and categorical data (Fig 1f, S1 Dataset).
Analysis of the genomic structure of and relationship among soybean
accessions
Phylogenetic analysis was conducted based on the identity-by-state coefficient matrix calcu-
lated using Plink v1.90b [48]. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the BIO-neigh-
bor-joining algorithm [49] and FigTree v1.4.3 (htp/tre-bio.cdacukk/sofware/igtred) (Fig
la). Structure analysis was conducted using fastSTRUCTURE v1.0 [50], based on a variational
Bayesian framework (Fig 1b). The number ofgenetic clusters (K) was set at six, considering
the error values of10-fold cross-validation (S1 Fig). The error value was thelowest at K == 6.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed by applying singular value decomposition
to the distant matrix calculated using the Kimura two-parameter model [51], and then dis-
played using the PCaxes 1, 2, and 3 (Fig lcand 1d). The linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern
was computed using PopLDdecay v3.2 [52]. The mean value ofLD was calculated within 100
and 500 kb regions (S1 Table), and the degree ofLD up to 500 kb is displayed in Fig le. Nucle-
otide diversity (T) was calculated using a 10 kb slide size with a 100 kb window size using
VCFtools v4.2 [53], and inbreeding coefficient (F) was estimated using the method of
moments in VCFtools (S1 Table). Additionally, using the same software, fixation index value
(Fst) was calculated using a 10 kb slide size with a 100 kb window size.
GWAS
An association study between genomic regions and flowering time was conducted using a
compressed mixed linear model within Genomic Association and Prediction Integrated Tool
[54]. The MAF-filtered 78,427 SNP markers (MAF > 0.05) was used to consider common
markers (S2 Dataset), anda statistically significant cut-offvalue was adopted to -log
(p-value) = 7. To minimize false-positive results, the cut-offwas set slightly higher than the
Bonferonni-corrected -log(p-value) of6.2. The extent of model fitting was confirmed using a
quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot for the expected and obtained p-values. After GWAS based on
SNP markers, gene annotations were performed using SnpEff v4.3 [55]. Allresults are summa-
rizedin S3 Dataset, and genome-wide plots including the Q-Q plot are shown in Fig 2.

ing approach was conducted. First, genes affecting DTF and maturity in Arabidopsis were

examined [56-59], and a total of 356 Arabidopsis genes were identified (Table 1, S4 Dataset).
Second, nucleotide sequences of these Arabidopsis genes were mapped onto the soybean refer-
ence genome Wm82.a2.vl using tBLASTX [60] with matching identity >80% and alignment
length >70 bp options, and a total of 2,643 homologous soybean genes were identified. Third,
2,188 genes belonging to the Axiom R 180k SoyaSNP array were identified among the 2,643
soybean genes, and 5,447 SNP markers contained in the 2,188 genes were obtained. Finally,
the 5,447 SNP markers were combined with 93 significant genic SNP markers derived in the
GWAS (-log(p-value) > 7), and a total of5,534 SNP markers (excluding 6 overlapping SNP
markers) was constructed as the final SNP marker-set for the multilocus epistatic analysis. All
results, including the number ofSNP markers per gene, are summarized in S4 Dataset, and a
briefsummary is provided in Table 1.
Multilocus epistatic interactions
Multilocus interactions among the 5,534 SNP markers related to DTF were examined using
Bayesian High-order Interaction Toolkit (BHIT) [61] with 1,000,000 iterations and 990,000
burn-in periods. The relationship between SNPs (X) and trait (Y) in multilocus interactions
was inferred as P(Y, HI,H) by grouping dependent genotypes (I) and phenotypes (H) [61].
Then, the likelihood was estimated using the following equation:
H
M

P(Y,HJI,H) = P(YXT-1)) P(Xu-n1) == II(P(YmIXue) == m)II P(Xu-n)1))

where,X-h indicates all Xin the hth group, and Y/m) indicates Y in the mth cluster. For P
(X1-nlD), Dirichlet prior distribution and multinomial distribution were used as the Bayesian
partition model [62]. The threshold for the posterior probabilities on the dependency for mul-
tilocus and phenotype was set at 0.5. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach was then used to
search potential epistatic marker sets, and a Bayesian computational approach was utilized to
detect finalhigh-order epistatic market sets. All results ofmultilocus epistatic interactions are
summarized in Table 2, and displayed in Circular-Manhattan plots in Fig 3. To more comple-
ment the multilocus epistasis, two-locus epistatic interactions were investigated to the BHIT
results. The two-locus epistatic test was conducted using a fixed linear regression model ofthe
Plink v1.90b [48], and the resultingp-values are summarized in Table 2.
Results
Genomic structure of cultivated soybeans
A large data set of2,662 cultivated soybean accessions, originated from Korea (2,511), the USA
(60), China (59), and Japan (32), were used in this study. These accessions included 335 ICs,
2,175 LRs, and 152 UCs (S1 Dataset). Korean accessions accounted for approximately 94.33%
ofthe entire soybean collection, and covered with most ofthe soybean accessions in Korea.
These 2,662 accessions were genotyped using the Axiom R 180k SoyaSNP array developedby
our team in 2016 [45], and a total of 180,961 SNP markers were identified. These SNP markers
represented 39,674 soybean genes, with an average number of 2.80 SNP markers per gene.
Prior to GWAS, the genomic structure of 2,510 accessions (2,175 LRs and 335 ICs, excluding
152 UCs) was examined using the SNP markers (Fig 1). These 2,510 accessions represented a
single large population with considerable genomic diversity. A phylogenetic tree was con-
structed Ito radial forms rather than branched forms with distinct clades, and LRs and ICs
exhibited a mixed aspect with each other (Fig la). Structure analysis revealed similar genomic
composition and proportion between LRs and ICs at K= 2 (Fig 1b; green andblue). With the

increase in the value ofK, the entire IC group showed la unique genomic composition, which
slightly distinguished from the LR group; however, each accession in the IC group exhibited
an aspect ofinclusion in the LR group, with varying levels ofgenomic composition. The results
ofPCA showed that the LR and IC groups formed a single group with large diversity, and the
IC group overlapped with the LR group, consistent with the results of structure analysis (Fig 1c
and 1d). Average values ofLD, TI, and DTF showed differences between the IC and LR groups.
Due to the impact ofconscious selection for improvement, the IC group showed slightly
higher average values ofLD (0.121583) (Fig le, S1 Table), andlower T (2.22E-5) and DTF
(42.16) (Fig 1f, S1 Dataset) than the LR group (0.112253, 2.39E-5, and 45.86, respectively). Val-
ues ofinbreeding coefficient were all high (IC, F = 0.9710; LR, F = 0.9731) because ofthe char-
acteristics ofinbreeding and stringent cleistogamy (S1 Table).. Also, a numeric value Fst,
supported the results ofvarious population analyses. The Fst between the IC and LR groups
was 0.0581 and was small enough to be regarded as a single group. Based on these results, a sin-
gle dataset consisting ofall 2,662 accessions was constructed, and used for subsequent GWAS
and epistatic analysis. The results ofPCA indicated that 132 UCs overlapped between the LR
and IC groups; these accessions were included in GWAS to reflect as much genomic diversity
ofcultivated accessions as possible.
GWAS of DTF
Ofthe 180,961 SNP markers identified in 2,662 accessions, 78,427 SNP markers with
MAF > 0.05 were selected as common SNP markers for GWAS. These SNP markers were dis-
tributed on all 20 soybean chromosomes and represented 26,162 genes, with an average num-
ber of2.07 SNP markers per gene (S2 Dataset). Then, the association between these SNP
markers and DTF was examined using a compressed mixedlinear model that adjusts popula-
tion structure and kinship (Fig 2, S3 Dataset). Statistically significant cut-offwas set at -log(p-

value) = 7, which was higher than the Bonferroni-adjusted p-value = 6.2, to minimize false-
positive results. A total of 132 significant SNP markers including 93 genic SNP markers were
detected, and all mapped to chromosomes 6 and 19 (Fig 2a). Among these 93 significant genic
SNP markers, 78 SNP markers mapped to 51 soybean genes on chromosome 6 (Fig 2b), and
15 SNP markers mapped to eight genes on chromosome 19 (Fig 2c).
The two major DTF-related genes, E1 and E3, were identified from the 59 significant genes.
The E1 gene has the largest influence on the determination OfDTF [37, 63] and affects vegeta-
tive development by regulating multiple genes related to plant growth [64]. The E1 gene was
located at the 20,207,322bp position on chromosome 6 (Glyma.06G207800), and showed la
considerably significant -log(p-value) of 14.23. The E3 gene regulates DTF under short-day
and long-day conditions, and affects plant maturity [65]. This gene was positioned at
47,638,344 bp on chromosome 19 (Glyma.19G224200) and exhibited a significant -log(p-
value) of9.75. Two additional major genes affecting DTF, E2 and E4 [66, 67], were not
detected as significant genes in this study. The E2 gene was located at nucleotide positions
45,295,453, 45,295,508, 45,296,750, and 45,300,271 bp on chromosome 10 (Gly-
ma.10G221500), but all showed non-significant p-values of2.00, 2.43, 2.31, and 2.43, respec-
tively (Fig 2a). Also the E4 gene was positioned at 33,236,286, 33,236,286, and 33,241,589 bp
on chromosome 20 (Glyma.20G090000), but all were excluded from the GWAS because oflow
MAF (0.000187, 0.000909, and0.002441, respectively).
Epistatic interaction among DTF-related genes
Interaction effects on DTF among significant SNP and non-significant SNP markers were
examined to complement GWAS singlevariantaditieffet. Significant SNP markers con-
sisted of93 genic SNP markers belonging to 59 soybean genes derived from the GWAS, as
described above. To focus on interactions among DTF-related genes, 5,441 non-significant
SNP markers in 2,184 soybean genes (Table 1) were selected from a set of356 DTF-related
Arabidopsis genes on the Axiom R 180k SoyaSNP array (S4 Dataset) (see Materials and meth-
ods for details). In the 356 Arabidopsis genes, a total of2,188 homologous soybean genes were
identified, but four genes (Glyma.06G205700, Glyma.06G207800-El, Glyma.06G221000, and
Glyma.19G224200-E3) with six SNP markers were excluded from the non-significant SNP
marker-set since these markers were already included in the significant marker-set in GWAS.
Also, when detecting homologous genes, the non-MAF filtered SNPS were used in order to
consider various DTF-related genes which were excluded from the GWAS due to
MAF < 0.05, such as E4 gene (Glyma.20G090000). Finally, a total of5,534 SNP markers
belonging to 2,243 soybean genes were selected and used for analyzing multilocus epistatic
interactions. The results revealed five interaction groups(G1-G5) containing two significant
and nine non-significant genes (Fig 3a) and two interaction groups (G6, G7) containing only
eight non-significant genes (Fig 3b, Table 2).
The interaction groups G1, G2, and IG3 containedtwo, three, and five genes, respectively,
each including the significant DTF-related E1 gene (Fig 3a, Table 2). The non-significant
genes, identified in GWAS, included GIF3 (belonging to G1 group and quantitative trait locus
(QTL) of pod maturity 9-1), which is involved in regulating cell expansion and meristem of
leaves [68]; SPL12 (G2, plant height QTL 38-2), which affects plant growth and development
[69]; COP1 (G2), which regulates photomorphogenesis and skotomorphogenes, and is related
to growth and development [70]; FUL (G3, first flower QTLs 4-1, 5-1,12-2, 26-9, and 26-
12), which functions early in controlling flowering time [71, 72]; EMF1 (G3), which is involved
in DTF through the regulation ofreproductive development [73, 74]; FKF1 (G3), involvedin
DTF by regulating changes in photoperiod and temperature [75, 76]; and NF-YB8 (G3 and G5,

pod maturity QTLs 14-2 and 15-2), which regulates leafdevelopment and maturity [77]. The
interaction groups G4 and G5 possessed the E3 gene in common, together with one and two
other genes, respectively (Fig 3a, Table 2), including STM (G4, first flower QTL 12-3), which
is related to flower meristem and DTF [78]; FLK (G5, plantheight QTL 26-17), which regu-
lates DTF through the repression OfFLOWERING LOCUS C expression and its post-transcrip-
tional modification [76]; and NF-YB8 (G5), also detected in G3, as described above.
The G6 and G7 interaction groups contained only eight non-significant genes identified lin
GWAS, but were detected as significant interaction groups on DTF in the epistatic analysis
(Fig 3b, Table 2). These eight genes included HAP5A (G6, one plant height QTL and three pod
maturity QTLs), related to earlier flowering [79]; ARP6 (G6, eight first flower QTLS), involved
in plant growth and development [80, 81]; FUL (G6), also identified in G3, as described above;
BBX15 (G6), indirectly related to light reaction [82]; SWN (G7), involved in the regulation of
flowering and development [83, 84]; FVE (G7), associated with the regulation and control of
DTF [85, 86]; and PHYE and CRY2 (G7, two pod maturity QTLs and one plantheight QTL),
related to light reaction during flowering [87, 88].
Pathways of epistatic genes related to DTF
To identify the degree ofinvolvement in DTF, two significant and 16 non-significant genes
in all interaction groups were examined on DTF-related pathways. These 18 candidate
genes were involved in the following six major DTF-related pathways [56]: ambient temper-
ature (AM), autonomous (AU), flowering pathway integrator (FPI), photoperiod (P), floral
meristem identity (FMI), and vernalization (V) (Table 2, Fig 4). The V and P pathways con-
trol the overall flowering process [89] and the AM pathway regulates flowering time [90,
91], as external factors. The AU pathway promotes induction of flowering as an internal fac-
tor [89]. The FPI pathway regulates the other pathways and triggers the induction ofFMI
[89], and the FMI pathway induces flowering. The P pathway contained eight candidate
genes including the E1 and E3 genes; A and AM pathways contained two candidate genes
each; AU and FPI pathways contained four candidate genes each; and the FMI pathway con-
tained three candidate genes. These results confirmed that all 18 candidate genes are
involved in major DTF-related pathways, and presented that they have a wide effect on DTF
while interacting with each other.
Discussion
The Axiom 180k SoyaSNP array was developedby our team mainly based on Korean soy-
bean accessions, with the aim to perform GWAS using a large number ofhigh-density markers
[45]. Ofthe 2,662 soybean accessions used in this study (S1 Dataset), 94% were of Korean ori-
gin and therefore suitable for genotyping with the Axiom R 180k SoyaSNP high-density array,
generating 180,961 SNP markers. These 2,662 soybean accessions mainly comprised two sub-
groups, LRs and ICs, andhave a tendency to form a single large population with considerable
genomic diversity (Fig 1). The Fst value, a numeric value indicating population structure, was
also sufficiently small (0.0581) for the two subgroups to be considered as a single group (S1
Table). Based on the results of population structure analyses, we conducted GWAS on all
2,662 soybean accessions and identified 59 soybean genes, including E1 and E3, as candidates
associated with DTF (Fig 2, S2 and S3 Datasets).
Genes E1-E10 [31-41),J142], and Dtl [43, 44] are known as major DTF-related genes in
soybean. Among these, genes E1-E4 act as the major determinants of DTF, as these genes
account for approximately 62-66% of variation in DTF [40, 57]. The E1 gene has the largest
effect on DTF and photoperiod sensitivity [37, 63] through regulations of GmFT2a, GmFT5a,

and GmFTla genes [92, 93]. The E2 gene enhances photoperiod response and contributes to
early flowering by regulating GmFT2a [66, 94]. Genes E3 and E4 are involved in the regulation
ofE1 and affect DTF through the regulation ofthe far-red light ratio [65, 67]. Above all, E1
functions as a key regulator ofDTF in soybean [95]. In our GWAS, E1 and E3 genes showed
significant p-values, whereas E2 and E4 genes were not detected (Fig 2). The E2 gene showed a
non-significant p-value and the E4 gene was excluded from the GWAS because ofconsiderably
low MAF ofSNPs. According to previous studies, the E1-E4 genes in soybean are considerably
affected by habitat ecology and latitude [57, 96-98]. The soybean population used in this study
consists mostly of Korean accessions and therefore reflects the Korean environment. Korean
soybeans are also reported to possess high genomic diversity, unlike soybean accessions from
other regions [99-101]. Considering the genomic characteristic of four population, the GWAS
result suggests that E1 and E3 genes play a significant role in the regulation ofDTF trait in
Korean soybean population.
In addition to GWAS results, the interaction effects between 59 significant genes and the
remaining non-significant genes on DTF were examined (Table 1). Identification of epistatic
interactions could help in the detection ofa greater number of candidate genes, since the

complex DTF trait is affected by interactions among multiple genes [29, 102]. In our epistatic
analysis, non-significant genes were utilized as 2,188 soybean genes which are homologous
genes to 356 DTF-related Arabidopsis genes (S4 Dataset). This approach ofmarker reduction,
called biological filtering, has been reported as one of the effective approaches for epistatic
analysis [103, 104], as it allows the overcoming of computational limitations caused by a con-
siderable number of marker combinations [105]. Therefore, we selected 356 Arabidopsis genes
based on previous reports on DTF and maturity (S4 Dataset), and used to analyze the interac-
tion effects ofvarious DTF-related genes on DTF. The results of epistatic analysis revealed
seven interaction groups and 18 candidate genes with significant influence on DTF (Table 2);
E1 and E3 genes, which were detectedin GWAS, also played la major role in the interaction
groups (Fig 3).
DTF is regulated by complex networks ofbiological processes [106, 107], and is character-
ized to six representative pathways from vegetative to flowering stages in Arabidopsis [108,
109]: P (response to daylength andlight), V (cold exposure), AU (flowering promotion), FPI
(floral transition), AM (time offloraltransition), and FMI (floral development) (Fig 4). To bet-
ter understand the genetic effects ofcandidate genes on DTF, it tis necessary to identify the
extent to which these candidate genes are involved in the six major pathways. Among the 18
candidate genes identified in this study, eight genes including E1 (interaction groups G1-G3)
are involved in P, FPI, FMI, and V pathways; four genes including E3 (G4 and G5) are associ-
ated with P, AU, and FPI pathways; and eight genes (G6 and G7) are relatedto P, V,AU, AM,
FMI, and FPI pathways (Table 2, Fig 4). Thus, all ofthese 18 candidate genes were evenly dis-
tributed in the six major pathways and affected DTF while interacting with each other in the
corresponding interaction groups. Overall, our results ofGWAS and epistatic analysis suggest
that these 18 candidate genes play a significant role in the regulation ofDTF in soybean, at
least in the Korean population.
However, our findings have several limitations. First, the DTF-related candidate markers
identified in this study do not represent the worldwide soybean population. Itis possible that
these candidate markers are specific to Korean soybean accessions because 94% ofthe soybean
population was of Korean origin. Second, the epistatic analysis was restricted to only 356 DTF-
related Arabidopsis genes. The 356 genes were used to reduce computational overload; how-
ever, markers excluded in the epistatic analysis could also have a significant effect on DTF
while interacting with each other. Finally, our candidate markers have not been validated by
biological experiments. To minimize this limitation, we examined the genomic characteristics
ofthe soybean population before GWAS and used la conservative cut-offin GWAS, which was
higher than the Bonferroni-adjusted p-value. Despite these efforts, our candidate markers
need further experimental validation, but they are expected to present valuable information to
soybean breeding programs aimed at improving the DTF trait.
Conclusion
DTF is an important agronomic trait relevant to plant growth, development, and productivity
in soybean. This trait is regulated by complex biological processes and lis affected by endoge-
nous genetic factors as well as environmental cues. Many researches have demonstrated the
effect of genotype X environment interaction on DTF; however, studies on epistatic interac-
tions amonggenetic factors have rarely been reported. Although our study is restricted lby the
origin of soybean accessions and also requires further biological validation, candidate markers
identified in this study provides not only additional information for understanding the DTF
trait in soybean but also a valuable genetic basis for soybean breeding programs aimed at
improving DTF.
