Abstract
Key message A whole-genome resequencing-derived SNP dataset identified six quantitative trait loci (QTL) sig-
nificantly associated with colonization of soybean by an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (Rhizophagus intraradices).
Candidate genes identified in these QTL regions include homologs to known nodulin protein families and other
symbiosis-specific genes.
Abstract Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form associations with over 80% of all terrestrial plant species and assist
their host plants by increasing their nutrient uptake, drought tolerance, and resilience against pathogens and pests. Genotypic
variation ofcrop plants to AMF colonization has been identified in crops, including soybean; however, the genetics control-
ling levels of AMF colonization in soybean are unknown. The overall goal of our study was to identify genomic regions
associated with mycorrhizal colonization in soybean using genome-wide association analysis. A diverse panel of 350 exotic
soybean genotypes inoculated with Rhizophagus intraradices were microscopically evaluated for root colonization using a
modified gridline intersect method. Root colonization differed significantly (P<0.001) among genotypes and ranged from 11
to 70%. A whole-genome resequencing-derived SNP dataset identified six quantitative trait loci (QTL) significantly associ-
ated with R. intraradices colonization that explained 24% of the phenotypic variance. Candidate genes identified in these
QTL regions include homologs to known nodulin protein families and other symbiosis-specific genes. The results showed
there was a significant genetic component to the level of colonization by R. intraradices in soybean. This information may
be useful in the development of AMF-sensitive soybean cultivars to enhance nutrient uptake, drought tolerance, and disease
resistance in the crop.
