virus in soybean plant introductions

Abstract
Background: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a useful tool for detecting and characterizing traits of
interest including those associated with disease resistance in soybean. The availability of 50,000 single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) markers (SoySNP50K iSelect BeadChip; www.soybase.org) on 19,652 soybean and wild soybean
plant introductions (Pls) in the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection allows for fast and robust identification of loci
associated with a desired phenotype. By using a genome-wide marker set to predict phenotypic values, genomic
prediction for phenotype-unknown but genotype-determined Pls has become possible. The goal of this study was
to describe the genetic architecture associated with sensitivity to Tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV) infection in the
USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection.
Results: TRSV-induced disease sensitivities of the 697 soybean Pls were rated on a one to five scale with plants
rated as one exhibiting mild symptoms and plants rated as five displaying terminal bud necrosis (ie., bud blight).
The GWAS identified a single locus on soybean chromosome 2 strongly associated with TRSV sensitivity. Cross-
validation showed a correlation of 0.55 (P< 0.01) to TRSV sensitivity without including the most significant SNP
marker from the GWAS as a covariate, which was a better estimation compared to the mean separation by using
significant SNPS. The genomic estimated breeding values for the remaining 18,955 unscreened soybean Pls in the
USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection were obtained using the GAPIT R package. To evaluate the prediction
accuracy, an additional 55 soybean accessions were evaluated for sensitivity to TRSV, which resulted in a correlation
of 0.67 (P< 0.01) between actual and predicted severities.
Conclusion: A single locus responsible for TRSV sensitivity in soybean was identified on chromosome 2. Two
leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase genes were located near the locus and may control sensitivity of soybean to
TRSV infection. Furthermore, a comprehensive genomic prediction for TRSV sensitivity for all accessions in the USDA
Soybean Germplasm Collection was completed.
