Abstract
Background: Soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines Ichinohe, has been one of the most devastating
pathogens affecting soybean production. In the United States alone, SCN damage accounted for more than $1
billion loss annually. With a narrow genetic background of the currently available SCN-resistant commercial cultivars,
high risk of resistance breakdown can occur. The objectives of this study were to conduct a genome-wide association
study (GWAS) to identify QTL, SNP markers, and candidate genes associated with soybean leaf chlorophyll content
tolerance to SCN infection, and to carry out a genomic selection (GS) study for the chlorophyll content tolerance.
Results: A total of 172 soybean genotypes were evaluated for the effect of SCN HG Type 1.2.3.5.6.7 (race 4) on soybean
leaf chlorophyll. The soybean lines were genotyped using a total of 4089 filtered and high-quality SNPS. Results
showed that (1) a large variation in SCN tolerance based on leaf chlorophyll content indices (CCI); (2) a total of 22, 14,
and 16 SNPS associated with CCI of non-SCN-infected plants, SCN-infected plants, and reduction of CCI SCN,
respectively; (3) a new locus of chlorophyll content tolerance to SCN mapped on chromosome 3; (4) candidate
genes encoding for Leucine-rich repeat protein, plant hormone signaling molecules, and biomolecule transporters; and
(5) an average GS accuracy ranging from 0.31 to 0.46 with all SNPS and varying from 0.55 to 0.76 when GWAS-derived
SNP markers were used across five models. This study demonstrated the potential of using genome-wide selection to
breed chloophylcontentioleant soybean for managing SCN.
Conclusions: In this study, soybean accessions with higher CCI under SCN infestation, and molecular markers
associated with chlorophyll content related to SCN were identified. In addition, a total of 15 candidate genes
associated with chlorophyll content tolerance to SCN in soybean were also identified. These candidate genes
will lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control chlorophyll content tolerance
to SCN in soybean. Genomic selection analysis of chlorophyll content tolerance to SCN showed that using
significant SNPS obtained from GWAS could provide better GS accuracy.
