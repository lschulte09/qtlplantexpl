Fig. 1. Population development for the biparental mapping, near isogenic line (NIL) development, and fine-mapping populations of soybean.
Here, 239 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were generated from the initial hybridization of Fiskeby III and Mandarin (Ottawa). After quantitative
trait locus (QTL) mapping in the F37 generation, six RILs with residual heterozygosity in individuals were found and used to generate heteroge-
neous inbred families (HIFs), depicted by red circles. Heterozygous plants within HIFs were advanced to the F, generation. Homozygous NIL
pairs were identified in the Fo.10 generation, and Fion seed was harvested for planting in the 2016 iron deficiency chlorosis (IDC) nursery. Fur
ther inbreeding was conducted from Fo10 heterozygous individuals to develop Fnaz NIL pairs for phenotyping in the 2017 IDC nursery.
