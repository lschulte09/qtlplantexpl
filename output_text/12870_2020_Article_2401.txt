Sclerotinia sclerotiorum resistance in
soybean using whole-genome
resequencing data
Chiheb Boudhrioua, Maxime Bastien, Davoud Torkamaneh and François Belzile D
Abstract
Background: Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR), caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary, is an important cause of
yield loss in soybean. Although many papers have reported different loci contributing to partial resistance, few of
these were proved to reproduce the same phenotypic impact in different populations.
Results: In this study, we identified a major quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with resistance to SSR
progression on the main stem by using a genome-wide association mapping (GWAM). A population of 127
soybean accessions was genotyped with 1.5 M SNPS derived from genovyping-bysequending (GBS) and whole-
genome sequencing (WGS) ensuring an extensive genome coverage and phenotyped for SSR resistance. SNP-trait
association led to discovery of a new QTL on chromosome 1 (Chr01) where resistant lines had shorter lesions on
the stem by 29 mm. A single gene (Glyma.01 g048000) resided in the same LD block as the peak SNP, but it is of
unknown function. The impact of this QTL was even more significant in the descendants of a cross between two
lines carrying contrasted alleles for Chr01. Individuals carrying the resistance allele developed lesions almost 50%
shorter than those bearing the sensitivity allele.
Conclusion: These results suggest that the new region on chromosome 1 harbors a promising resistance QTL to
SSR that can be used in soybean breeding program.
