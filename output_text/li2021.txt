Abstract
Background Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is an economically important crop for vegetable oil and protein production,
and yield is a critical trait for grain/vegetable uses of soybean. However, our knowledge of the genes controlling the vegetable
soybean yield remains limited.
Objective To better understand the genetic basis of the vegetable soybean yield.
Methods The 100-pod fresh weight (PFW), 100-seed fresh weight (SFW), kernel percent (KP) and moisture content of
fresh seeds (MCFS) at the R6 stage are four yield-related traits for vegetable soybean. We investigated a soybean mini core
collection composed of 224 germplasm accessions for four yield-related traits in two consecutive years. Based on 1514
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS), genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted using a mixed linear
model (MLM).
Results Extensive phenotypic variation existed in the soybean mini core collection and significant positive correlations were
shown among most of traits. A total of 16 SNP markers for PFW, SFW, KP and MCFS were detected in all environments via
GWAS. Nine SNP markers were repeatedly identified in two environments. Among these markers, eight were located in or
near regions where yield-related QTLs have been reported in previous studies, and one was a novel genetic locus identified
in this study. In addition, we conducted candidate gene analysis to the large-effect SNP markers, a total oftwelve genes were
proposed as potential candidate genes of soybean yield at the R6 stage.
Conclusion These results will be beneficial for understanding the genetic basis of soybean yield at the R6 stage and facilitat-
ing the pyramiding of favourable alleles for future high-yield breeding by marker-assisted selection in vegetable soybean.
