Water and nutrient acquisition is a critical function of plant root systems. Root system
architecture (RSA) traits are often complex and controlled by many genes. This is the
first genome-wide association study reporting genetic loci for RSA traits for field-grown
soybean (Glycine max). A collection of 289 soybean genotypes was grown in three
environments, root crowns were excavated, and 12 RSA traits assessed. The first
