Genome-wide association mapping of
partial resistance to Phytophthora sojae in
soybean plant introductions from the
Republic of Korea

Abstract
Background: Phytophthora root and stem rot is one of the most yield-limiting diseases of soybean [Glycine max
(L) Merr], caused by the oomycete Phytophthora sojae. Partial resistance is controlled by several genes and,
compared to single gene (Rps gene) resistance to P. sojae, places less selection pressure on P. sojae populations.
Thus, partial resistance provides a more durable resistance against the pathogen. In previous work, plant
introductions (Pls) originating from the Republic of Korea (S. Korea) have shown to be excellent sources for high
levels of partial resistance against P. sojae.
Results: Resistance to two highly virulent P. sojae isolates was assessed in 1395 Pls from S. Korea via a greenhouse
layer test. Lines exhibiting possible Rps gene immunity or rot due to other pathogens were removed and the
remaining 800 lines were used to identify regions of quantitative resistance using genome-wide association
mapping. Sixteen SNP markers on chromosomes 3, 13 and 19 were significantly associated with partial resistance to
P. sojae and were grouped into seven quantitative trait loci (QTL) by linkage disequilibrium blocks. Two QTL on
chromosome 3 and three QTL on chromosome 19 represent possible novel loci for partial resistance to P. sojae.
While candidate genes at QTL varied in their predicted functions, the coincidence of QTLS 3-2 and 13-1 on
chromosomes 3 and 13, respectively, with Rps genes and resistance gene analogs provided support for the
hypothesized mechanism of partial resistance involving weak R-genes.
Conclusions: QTL contributing to partial resistance towards P. sojae in soybean germplasm originating from S.
Korea were identified. The QTL identified in this study coincide with previously reported QTL, Rps genes, as well as
novel loci for partial resistance. Molecular markers associated with these QTL can be used in the marker-assisted
introgression of these alleles into elite cultivars. Annotations of genes within QTL allow hypotheses on the possible
mechanisms of partial resistance to P. sojae.
