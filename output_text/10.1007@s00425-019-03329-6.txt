Abstract
Main conclusion A total of 41 SNPs were identified as significantly associated with five yield-related traits in wild
soybean populations across multiple environments, and the candidate gene GSCID1 was found to be associated with
seed weight. These results may facilitate improvements in cultivated soybean.
Abstract Crop-related wild species contain new sources of genetic diversity for crop improvement. Wild soybean (Glycine
soja Sieb. and Zucc.) is the progenitor of cultivated soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and can be used as an essential genetic
resource for yield limprovements. In this research, using genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 96 out of 113 wild soy-
bean accessions with 114,090 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS) (with minor allele frequencies <0.05), SNPs associ-
ated with five yield-related traits were identified across multiple environments. In total, 41 SNPS were significantly associ-
ated with the traits in two or more environments (significance threshold P <8.76x10-5, with 29, 7,3, and 2 SNPs detected
for 100-seed weight (SW), maturity time (MT), seed yield per plant (SY) and flowering time (FT), respectively. BLAST
search against the Glycine soja W05 reference genome was performed, 20 candidate genes were identified based on these
41 significant SNPS. One candidate gene, GSCID1 (Glysoja.04g010563), harbored two significant SNPS-AX-93713187,
with a non-synonymous mutation, and AX-93713188, with a synonymous mutation. GSCID1 was highly expressed during
seed development based on public information resources. The polymorphisms in this gene were associated with SW. We
developed a derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) marker for GSCID1 that was highly associated with
SW and was validated as a functional marker. In summary, the revealed SNPs/genes are useful for understanding the genetic
architecture of yield-related traits in wild soybean, which could be used as a potential exotic resource to improve cultivated
soybean yields.
