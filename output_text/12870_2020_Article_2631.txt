Abstract
Background: Mineral nutrients play a crucial role in the biochemical and physiological functions of biological
systems. The enhancement of seed mineral content via genetic improvement is considered as the most promising
and cost-effective approach compared alternative means for meeting the dietary needs. The overall objective of
this study was to perform a GWAS of mineral content (Ca, K P and S) in seeds of a core set of 137 soybean lines
that are representative of the diversity of early maturing soybeans cultivated in Canada (maturity groups 000-11).
Results: This panel of 137 soybean lines was grown in five environments (in total) and the seed mineral content
was measured using a portable x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer. The association analyses were carried out
using three statistical models and a set of 2.2 million SNPS obtained from a combined dataset of genotyping-by
sequencing and whole-genome sequencing. Eight QTLS significantly associated with the Ca, K, P and S content
were identified by at least two of the three statistical models used (in two environments) contributing each from
17 to 31% of the phenotypic variation. A strong reproducibility of the effect of seven out these eight QTLS was
observed in three other environments. In total, three candidate genes were identified involved in transport and
assimilation of these mineral elements.
Conclusions: There have been very few GWAS studies to identify QTLS associated with the mineral element
content of soybean seeds. In addition to being new, the QTLS identified in this study and candidate genes will be
useful for the genetic improvement of soybean nutritional quality through marker-assisted selection. Moreover, this
study also provides details on the range of phenotypic variation encountered within the Canadian soybean
germplasm.

soybean lines. For each robust QTL (detected using multiple models in many environments), a region of interest was delimited by
flanking markers in perfect LD with the peak SNP. The identifier and annotation of candidate genes residing within the relevant
genomic regions are provided
