its complex genetic architecture and environmental sensitivity. In this paper, we inte-
grated GWAS across multiple environments, haplotype analysis, genetic transformation,
and diversity analysis to study the genetic architecture ofoil content and the underlying
mechanism in soybean. This combined analysis enabled us to identify an environmentally
stable QTL (GqOil20) and functionally verified that GmOLEO1 positively regulates total
seed oil accumulation in soybean seeds. In addition, we found that GmOLEO1 showed a
higher level of expression in cultivated soybean seeds than in wild soybean seeds, possibly
as the result ofthe positive selection ofthe promoter, resulting in seed oil accumulation.
Moreover, we identified an elite GmOLEO1 haplotype that correlated strongly with high
oil content in soybean, holding great potential for assisting oil improvement in soybean
breeding. Our study provided a new genetic resource for oil content improvement in soy-
bean and other oilseed crops.
Introduction
Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is an important food and oil crop. Soybean seeds accumulate
large amounts of oil and protein and have been intensively targeted for human consumption
during long-term domestication and cultivation. Given the high percentage ofoilin soybean
seeds, the demand for soybean oil production has increased dramatically due to the increasing
demand for vegetable oils and expanded use ofbiodiesel, and the seed composition improve-
ment is ofparticular interest in terms ofincreasing awareness ofhealth issues around dietary
fats [1]. However, oil accumulation in the seed is a complex metabolic process that is environ-
mentally sensitive; thus, stably expressed oil-enhancing key genes that can be applied to soy-
bean molecular breeding have rarely been reported, and the mechanism ofthe variance ofoil
content in soybean remains largely unknown.
In plants, accumulated oilin seeds is generally stored as triacylglycerols (TAGS). TAG syn-
thesis is initiatedfrom glucose in the cytosol, and the resulting products from glycolysis are
transported into the plastid for fatty acid (FA) synthesis. The FAs are processed by a series of
key enzymes to produce C16:0 and C18:0 acyl chains and desaturated products, such as C18:1.
FA products are then exported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to form TAGS via the acyl-
CoA-dependent and acyl-CoA-independent pathways [2]. The resulting TAGS are present in
subcellular sphericallipid droplets in various plant tissues; thel lipid droplets stored in seeds
are usually called oil bodies (OBs) and have been extensively investigated previously in studies
of, for instance, the structure and composition of an OB and the essential role of OB-related
proteins, such as oleosins, in OB formation, mobilization, and oil accumulation [3-10]. Previ-
ous studies have indicated that oleosins play conserved roles in OB formation in seeds in sev-
eral oilseed plants [7-8]. Suppression ofa soybean oleosin produces micro-OBs [10], while the
effects ofOBs on seed oil accumulation have rarely been reported in soybean. The soybean
genome contains 13 putative oleosin-encoding genes [11], andifany ofthem are involved in
oil accumulation remain unexploited.
By linkage and linkage disequilibrium mapping, over 300 quantitative trait loci (QTLS)
associated with seed oil content have been identified across all 20 chromosomes in the soybean
genome over the past decades (SoyBase, https/Isoybase.org). These studies have revealed the

polygenic nature ofoil regulation, and the majority ofloci iwere found to have varying additive,
epistatic or QTLxenvironment effects [12-15], implying that traditional breeding based on
genetic crossing and phenotypic selection may be inadequate for oil improvement. Recent
studies have shown that increased oil in soybean could be achievedby genetic engineering of
transcription factors involved in oil accumulation [16-18] or a QTL gene controlling seed coat
bloom [19]. However, QTLs directly relatedto seed oil accumulation in soybean have not been
cloned; thus, the underlying mechanism has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. There-
fore, identifying an environmentally stable major QTL regulating seed oil contentis urgently
needed to substantially enhance seed oil content and understand the underlying regulatory
mechanism in soybean.
To reveal the genetic basis of seed oil content and elucidate how oil accumulation is regu-
lated, we investigated the oil content variation in 219 diverse soybean genotypes across six dif-
ferent environments and conducted a high-density genome-wide association study (GWAS)
using 201,994 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). In total, three QTLs
were identifiedto be significantly associated with soybean oil content across atleast two envi-
ronments, with GqOil20 on chromosome 20 stably expressing across all six environments. We
also found that an oleosin-encoding gene, GmOLEO1, in the GqOil20 linkage disequilibrium
(LD) block was exclusively expressed in developing seeds and that its expression level was sig-
nificantly correlated with oil content within selected genotypes. We subsequently verified that
GmOLEO1 contributedto oil accumulation in soybean seeds by conducting a series ofmolecu-
lar assays. Our results reveal an environmentally stable QTL/gene controlling oil accumulation
in soybean seeds, provide new insight into oil accumulation in soybean and offer new direc-
tions for breeding soybean varieties with enhanced seed oil content.
Results
GWAS identified a stably expressed QTL associated with oil content
To identify the genetic variation in seed oil content, we measured the oil contents of 219 soy-
bean genotypes with diverse genetic backgrounds across six different environments. Seedoil
content exhibited large amounts of natural variation within the association panel in each envi-
ronment and showed relative consistency across the six environments (S1A and S1B Fig, S1
Table). The mean oil content for the 219 accessions ranged from 18.10% to 18.97% across the
six environments, and the observed maximum oil content reached 27.69% in Environment 1
(E1), which was approximately three times higher than the minimum value (9.64%) observed
in E6 (S1A Fig, S1 Table). The distribution ofoil contentfor the association panel in each envi-
ronment was approximately normal (SIC Fig). Analysis ofvariance (ANOVA) indicated a sig-
nificant difference (p < 0.001) in oil content among the genotypes, the oil content was
significantly affected by environments (p < 0.001) (S1 Table), and the heritability was 0.64.
Because of the wide variation in seed oil content in the panel across the environments, we
performed GWAS for the oil contentin six environments (E1 to E6) and the best linear unbi-
ased prediction (BLUP) using 201,994 genome-wide SNPs with a minor allele frequency
(MAF) N 0.05 in an effort to identify the genetic loci associated with soybean oil content. In
total, 110 SNPS on three chromosomes (8, 12, and 20) were identified as significantly associ-
ated with oil content across at least two environments (S2 Fig, S2 Table). For the sake ofsim-
plicity, we empirically classified closely adjacent SNPslocated within 5 Mb into one locus, as
previously described [20]. The 110 SNPS were classified into three genomic loci, which were
subsequently designated GqOil8, GqOil12, and GqOil20 (S2 Fig, S2 Table). Ofthese QTLS, the
most significantly associated SNPS were identified in GqOil20, which was in physical proximity
to oil-related QTLs identified in previous studies (S2 Table) [21-24).Importantly, GqOil20

was consistently identified across all the environments and BLUP except E4 (Fig 1A),andit
explained 13.4-24.4% ofoil variation, representing the most stably expressed QTL for oil con-
tent in soybean.
GmOLEO1 is a candidate gene for GqOil20 and encodes oleosin
Itis known that oil content is a key domestication trait undergoing artificial selection [25], and
the regulatory genes involved were likely selected during domestication. Thus, a comparison
ofthe genetic diversity at the three loci between cultivated soybean (G. max) and wild soybean
(G.soja), the progenitor ofG. max, couldbe helpful in determining the most likely regions
containing the oil-controlling gene(s). To this end, we calculated genetic differentiation (Fst)
within the 140 kb regions upstream and downstream of each leading SNP per locus within a
group containing this association panel (272 G. max accessions) and a panel of 122 G. soja
accessions genotyped with the same microarray, as previously described [26]. After the com-
parison, we found that Fst showed variation, and the Fst across the entire group (G. max and
G. soja) was lower than the average Fst in the association panel (G. max only) in two QTLs
(GqOil8 and GqOil12). In contrast, most ofthe Fst values for GqOil20 were significantly higher
in the G. max-G. soja group than in the association panel, suggesting that artificial selection
might have occurred in this genomic region in relation to oil accumulation (S3 Fig), consistent
with the fact that soybean oil content is a domestication trait [25].In this regard, GqOil20 likely
harbors a gene or genes that have important functions in the regulation of soybean oil accumu-
lation. Thus, we next focused on Gq0il20 to identify oil-related genes.
To identify the candidate gene, we analyzed the LD region harboring the leading SNPs
using BLUP as a phenotype. Gq0il20 contained a total of 33 significant SNPS located within a
strong LD with an average 7 = 0.66 (Fig 1C). Ofthese genes within the LD according to the G.
max Wm82.a2v1 reference genome Omtplpbytewomeigadecgog (S2 Table), we found that
a gene, Glyma.20G196600, encoding a putative oleosin protein, colocated with the significant
SNP AX-93661332 (P =l 4.98 X 10-19)(Fig.1Aand 1B, S3 Table). Glyma.20G196600 is an ortho-
log of Arabidopsis AtOLE1 (AT4G25140), an oleosin-encoding gene with demonstrated roles
in oil body formation [9], while other gene models in this block are annotated to beinvolved
in defense responses (S3 Table). Thus, Glyma.20G196600 might be the candidate gene under-
lying GqOil20, and we designated it GmOLEO1 for further study.
Genetic variation and expression of GmOLEO1 correlated with seed oil
content
To investigate whether GmOLEO1 underlies the domestication region GqOil20, we examined
the expression patterns and sequence variations of GmOLEO1 alleles in 38 soybean accessions
comprising 27 cultivated and 11 wild genotypes with significant differences in oil content
between two subgroups (Fig 1D). Consistent with the observed high oil content in G. max rela-
tive to G. soja, GmOLEO1 showed significantly higher expression in cultivated soybeans than
in wild soybeans (Fig 1Dand 1E), indicating a correlation between the transcript abundance
of GmOLEO1 and oil content.
Next, a 2.3-kb genomic region extending from -1,500 bp upstream ofthe start codon
(ATG) to the 3-untranslated region (UTR) of GmOLEO1 was sequenced and analyzed.
Sequence analyses identified 12 nucleotide variants that divided the 38 germplasm into six
haplotypes (Hap), which were clearly classified into two subgroups (cultivated and wild) by a
phylogenetic tree (Fig 1H). Moreover, the six haplotypes represented six levels of seed oil con-
tent (Fig 1F and 1G), with Hapl seeds containing the highest oil content. Ofthe 12 nucleotide
variants, seven variants were found to be significantly associated with soybean oil content (Fig

- P= 1.26x10-3), and 1-167 (13-bp insertion/deletion, P == 3.13x10-3) being detected in the
promoter region and three (Ps26 == 5.36x10-3,Ps265 == 0.02, Ps393 == 0.04) occurring in the exon.
Ofthese variants, those in the promoter region represent the most significant variation associ-
ated with the variation in seed oil, suggesting that resulting differences in the expression of
GmOLEO1 among the haplotypes might taccount for the oil content variation.
To further determine whether variation in the promoter affected gene expression, we com-
pared the transcriptional activity ofthe promoters ofHapl and Hap5 (Hapl_pro and Hap5_-
pro) using a dualluciferase reporter gene assay. As shown in Fig 11, Hapl_pro exhibited
3.58-fold higher activity than Hap5_pro, consistent with the observedhigher expression of
Hapl than Hap5 (Fig 11). These results suggest that GmOLEO1 is a strong candidate for
GqOil20 and that expression level instead ofexon variation is an important factor affecting
seed oil content.
GmOLEO1 is localized to OBs and exclusively expressed in maturing seeds
Given that GmOLEO1 was a strong candidate associated with seed oil content, we character-
izedits protein structure, phylogeny, and expression pattern. BLASTP showed that GmOLEO1
is an ortholog ofArabidopsis AtOLE1 (AT4G25140), an oleosin-like protein with demon-
strated roles in OB formation [9] (Fig 2A and 2B). Similar to previously described OLE ortho-
logs in other species, GmOLEO1 contains three conserved structural domains (Fig 2A) [5].
Two amphipathic domains are located at the N- and C-termini, respectively, and a hydropho-
bic domain is located at the center. In the central hydrophobic domain, GmOLEO1 also con-
tains the conserved "proline knot" sequence (PX;SPX;P), which can form a loop including a
hydrophobic hairpin that penetrates into the TAG matrix and two arms located on both sides
ofthe knot (Fig 2A) [5]. This domain organization allows oleosins to be anchored on the sur-
face of an OB, as illustrated in a previous study [3]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that OLEO-
like proteins from the Faboideae, Brassicaceae, and grass clades clustered separately, suggest-
ing functional conservation within the clade and possible functional diversity between clades
(Fig 2B). In addition, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
analyses showed that GmOLEO1 has a low molecular mass (-16 KD) (Fig 2C), consistent with
previous findings [9, 27]. These results indicated that the uncharacterized gene GmOLEO1
encodes a putative OB protein that might play roles associated with OB formation or oil accu-
mulation in soybean.
To determine thetemporal and spatial expression pattern ofGmOLEO1, the expression lev-
els of GmOLEO1 were examined in ten different tissues and two soybean varieties with differ-
ent seed oil contents (H101, a high-oil variety; H112, a low-oil variety) (Fig 2D). Quantitative
real-time PCR (qPCR) results showed that GmOLEO1 transcripts were undetectable in non-
seed tissues, including the roots, stems, leaves, and flowers ofboth varieties, but its transcripts
couldbe detected in developing seeds beginning at the seed-filling stage (Fig 2D). The abun-
dance of GmOLEO1 transcripts in seeds increased with the number ofdays after flowering
(DAF), with the highest expression level observed in developing seeds at 40 DAF, which was
immediately before that seeds had completely matured (Fig 2D). Overall, the expression level
of GmOLEO1 in the developing seeds ofH101 was significantly greater than that in H112
seeds at all tested stages. These results indicated that GmOLEO1 functions specifically during
seed maturation and that transcript abundance positively correlated with oil content (Fig 1G).
We next investigated whether GmOLEO1 was spatially related to OBs. We expressed a 35S::
GmOLEO1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) construct in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana)
leaf epidermal cells by agro-infiltration followedby staining with Nile Red, a lipophilic dye

fluorescence and Nile Red fluorescence signal from OBs were colocalized in seedcells (Fig 2E),
indicating that GmOLEO1 waslocalized to accumulated OBs.
Taken together, the results ofhaplotype analysis, diversity analysis, phylogenetic analysis,
expression analysis, and subcellular localization supported the GWAS results and collectively
indicated that GmOLEO1 was a strong candidate gene underlying GqOil20 associated with oil
accumulation in soybean seeds.

the OE lines and wild type (WT), while its expression in the OE seeds was significantly higher
in OE than in WT at each stage of seed development. GmOLEO1 exhibited a sharp increase in
its expression in the OE lines at 25 DAF, which was five days earlier than the increase in
expression observed (30 DAF) in WT seeds. In agreement with the observed expression differ-
ence between the two soybean varieties described above (Fig 2D), expression of GmOLEO1 in
both the OE lines and WT increased continuously as the seeds developed andreached its high-
est levels at 40 DAF. This gene expression result was further verified by comparative Western
blot analysis ofGmOLEO1 protein between WT and the OE lines using an antibody against
GmOLEO1. A higher expression ofGmOLEO1 was observed in the three OE lines than in the
WT at 25 and 40 DAF (Fig 3C).
Compared with WT, mature seeds from OE lines had shinier surfaces with more yellowish
colors and smaller sizes (Fig 4A). The oil contents ofthe seeds ofthe three OE lines were
22.35%, 21.91%, and 22.14%, respectively, which were all significantly higher (an absolute
average increase of2.12%, a relative increase of10.6%, P = 4.6 x 10 -6) than that in WT seeds
(20.01%) (Fig 4F). Not surprisingly, the increase in oil content in the OE lines resulted in a sig-
nificant decrease (P = 0.006) in protein content (Fig 4G). To further verify the oil increase in
the OE seeds, we conducted a series ofmicroscopy analyses of developing OE seeds (OE-9 and
OE-18) at 25 DAF, where sharp increases in the expression ofGmOLEO1 and oleosin were
observed (Fig 4C-4F). Microscopy analyses of cross-sections from developing seeds stained
with Oil Red O showed that OE seeds have markedly stronger Oil Red O staining than WT
seeds, indicating that OE seeds contain a higher level of neutral lipid accumulation than WT
seeds (Fig 4B). A further examination ofthe seed cells using an optical microscope (Nikon,
Eclipse Ci, Japan) showed that more OBs were deposited in the two OE lines (OE-9 and OE-
18) than in WT (Fig 4C), and a consistent result was found via staining with toluidine blue O
(Fig 4D). These observations were further verified by a comparative analysis ofNile Red stain-
ing of Faccumulated oil between OE and WT seeds using a confocal microscope (Nikon, C2,
Japan) (Fig 4E). These results visibly illustrated that OE plants overexpressing GmOLEO1 con-
tained higher levels ofoil accumulation in seed cells than WT.
In addition, we observed that overexpression ofGmOLEO1 has pleiotropic effects on other
agronomic traits. The phenotypic evaluation indicated that the overexpression resulted in a
significant decrease in 100-seed weight in the OE lines compared with thatin WT (Fig41).
However, a significant increase (P < 0.01) in pod number per plant and a slight increase in
plant heightin the OE lines compared with WT lines (Fig 4H and 41) were observed, which led
to an increase (P= 0.017) in seed yield per OE plant compared with WT plants (Fig 4K, S4
Table). We also compared the seed germination between two lines. We found that seed germi-
nation and root growth were faster in the OE lines than in WT (Fig 4L). These results indicate
that GmOLEO1 is involved in oil accumulation in soybean seeds with pleiotropic effects on
yield-related traits, and no yield penalty was found in the current preliminary study.
In light ofthe role of GmOLEO1 in oil accumulation, we further measured andcompared
the fatty acids between WT and OE seeds to test whether GmOLEO1 affected FA composition
(Fig 5). Compared with the WT, OE seeds contained a higher average total FA content of

that two polyunsaturated oil components, linoleic acid (18:2) and linolenic acid (18:3), were
significantly increasedby 14.4% and 14.9% (P = 1.2x 10-4 and 19.7x 10-5, n = 3), respectively,

increased accumulation of polyunsaturated FAs.
Last, we compared the OBs ofOE and WT seeds using transmission electron microscopy.
At 25 and 40 DAF, the OBs ofWT seeds showed typically spherical and ovoid structures and
were distributed mostly between protein bodies at the periphery ofthe cells (Fig6). In contrast,
OE seed cells contained apparently smaller OBs than those ofWT (Fig6).

Overexpression of GmOLEO1 affected the expression of genes related and
unrelated to oil synthesis
To better understand the molecular mechanism by which GmOLEO1 increased oil accumula-
tion in soybean seeds, we compared the transcriptomes ofOE and WT seeds at three seed
development stages (20, 25 and 40 DAF) using RNA-seq analysis. In total, 796, 1238, and 1417
differentially expressed genes (DEGS) were identifiedby comparing OE with WT seeds at 20,
25, and 40 DAF, respectively (Fig 7A, S6-S8 Tables). The RNA-seq result was validatedby
qPCR analyses of16 randomly selected genes (S9 Table, R? == 0.84). We observed a trend
toward increasing numbers of DEGs as DAF increased (Fig 7B). This increasing trend in the
number ofDEGs is consistent with the pattern of oil content increase in seeds as DAF

increases (Fig 7B). This result indicated that overexpression of GmOLEO1 resulted in signifi-
cant changes in the transcriptomes in the developing OE seeds, and the changes became more
dramatic as the seeds developed. To understand the biological processes in which GmOLEO1
participates, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for these DEGS. In addi-
tion to the enrichment ofGO terms associated with the regulatory pathways essential for plant
growth and development, such as seed development and germination, amino acid and sucrose
metabolism, and response to growth hormone, we found that GO terms associated with lino-
leic acid metabolism, fatty acid transport, lipid metabolism and storage were also significantly
enriched for these DEGS (Fig 7D).
The RNA-seq results were further verified by the increased expression ofseveral known
genes participating in TAG biosynthesis in OE seeds as shown by qPCR, such as diacylglycerol
acyltransferase (DGAT1) [18], wrinkled 1 (WRI1) [29], zinc-finger protein (GmZF351) [17],
two Arabidopsis OLEO orthologs (AtOLE2 and AtOLE3) [30], and oil body associated protein 1
(OBAPIA) [31] (Fig 7C), indicating that the expression ofthese genes may be affected by GmO-
LEO1 overexpression. These results indicated that overexpression ofGmOLEO1 promoted the
expression ofTAG biosynthesis-related genes and lled to the enhancement of TAGbiosynthesis.
GmOLEO1 underwent artificial selection for increased seed oil
accumulation
Because higher expression of GmOLEO1 in cultivated soybean than in wild soybean was
observed, we hypothesized that the variations in its promoter region were under selection.

Statistical analyses were performed using alarge population of 302 soybean accessions [24].
We first evaluated Fst for different comparisons, including wild soybean VS. cultivar, wild soy-
bean VS. landrace, and cultivar VS. landrace. The results showed that the Fst between wild VS.
cultivated soybean is considerably higher than that between cultivar VS. landrace, especially in
the promoter region (Fig 8A and 8B). The nucleotide diversity (T) analysis showed that T was
higher in wild soybean than cultivated soybean in the promoter region and the coding region
(Fig8A). Tajima's Din the promoter region was 2.00, 0.06 and -0.84 for wild, landrace and cul-
tivar, respectively, while Tajima's D in the coding region was 1.22, -0.819, and 0.04 for wild,
landrace and cultivar, respectively (Fig 8A), implying that positive selection had occurred in
the promoter region. A phylogenetic analysis using variants in the promoter and coding
regions identified three clusters, corresponding to wild soybean, landrace, and cultivar (Fig
8C). Taken together, these results indicated that the promoter region was subjected to artificial
selection during domestication.
Discussion
Itis known that seed oil content has been subjected to artificial selection targeting higher oil
content [25]. This finding was further validatedby our study, in which a significant difference
in seed oil content between cultivated and wild soybeans was observed (Fig 1D). Unlike other
domestication traits in soybean, such as stem growth habit [32] andpod shattering [33], soy-
bean oil content is highly complex; it is regulatedby many genes of small effect and is easily
influenced by various environmental factors [1]. Our GWAS study across multiple environ-
ments allowed us to identify a new environmentally stable QTL, GqOil20, and an underlying
candidate gene, GmOLEO1 that is capable ofincreasing seed oil content in soybean. Notably,
the GmOLEO1 locus was previously identified as a possible candidate for an eQTL associated
with seed oil accumulation [34], and lit is physically close to other oil-related QTLs previously
identified by linkage mapping [21-23]. GmOLEO1 may have been identified in this study

PLOS GENETICS
GmOLEOtincreases soybean seed oil accumulation
because the corresponding alleles were fixed with respectto oil variation during domestication.
Given the complexity ofoil metabolism, the observed phenotypic variation (23.7%) couldbe
due to the combined effects of GmOLEO1 and other genes at this locus. Other oleosin genes,
regardless of sequence variation, with increased expression at the gene or protein level [35-36]
during seed filling/maturation may also substantially affect oil accumulation. Nevertheless, our
study further functionally verified that human-selected GmOLEO1 might be involved in seed
oil accumulation, possibly by indirectly affecting oilbiosynthesis via efficient feedback.
Our study and previous studies have indicated that the improvement of seed oil content in
soybean during domestication was achieved lby artificial selection of multiple major genes, and
some ofthose genes may not be directly involved in oilbiosynthesis, such as B1 [37] and
GmZF351 [17]. In contrast to previous studies that identified oil-related genes using a reverse
genetic approach, GmOLEO1 was pinpointed in an artificially selected locus, GqOil20, using
an integrated strategy ofhigh-density genetic mapping and genomics. Haplotype and expres-
sion analyses of GmOLEO1 between cultivated and wild soybean in our study provided addi-
tional evidence of selection at the GmOLEO1 locus. This artificially imposed selection pressure
on the expression ofGmOLEO1 could be an important factor affecting the observed difference
in oil accumulation in soybean, because the overexpression ofHap2 ofGmOLEO1 resulted in
enhanced oil accumulation in transgenic soybean (Figs 1G and 4F). Whether other genes in
this block have functions associated with oilaccumulation requires further determination.
Seed yield and quality represent two ofthe most important traits in soybean improvement.
Breeding soybeans with high oil stability across environments while maintaining protein con-
tent and yield has been difficult due to the complex genetic architecture ofoil regulation. In
our study, GmOLEO1 was functionally identified as a candidate for the environmentally stable
QTL GqOil20. Overexpression of GmOLEO1 significantly elevated oil content and the percent-
age of polyunsaturated FAs without detriment to the overall plant performance, especially
yield, in our preliminary study, making GmOLEO1 a promising candidate gene for use in
breeding high-oil soybeans with improved levels ofhealthy polyunsaturated FAs. Although
Hap2 (Williams 82-type) is not the most favored haplotype for increasing oil accumulation,
enhanced seed oil accumulation was observed in this study, indicating that the GmOLEO1
allele in Hap2 enhanced oil accumulation independent ofthe amino acid substitution (Ala265-
Pro). One possible reason for this finding is that the substitution, which does not change
hydropathy, may not affect the secondary structure ofoleosins in OBs. The strong correlation
between Hapl and high expression levels ofGmOLEO1 alleles (Fig 1) suggests the importance
of unique variation (Hapl) in the promoter region in enhancing the expression of GmOLEO1.
The discovery ofthe molecular function DNA marker, Indel P237167, from the unique varia-
tion in the promoter ofGmOLEO1 will facilitate marker-assisted selection (MAS) in soybean
high-oilbreeding programs.
The importance of oleosins in lipid accumulation and oil body formation in seed plants has
been gradually recognized over the past three decades, and lithas demonstrated an important
role in the maintenance ofOBs and preventing them from coalescence [9]. The Arabidopsis
genome contains 17 oleosin genes [38], ofwhich AtOLE1 has been reported to be involvedin
lipid biosynthesis [39]. In soybean, 13 putative oleosin genes were found in the G. max refer-
ence genome, while only GmOLEO1 colocalized with the associated SNP (AX-93661332) in
GqOil20 in our study (S10 Table). The overexpression of GmOLEO1 showed consistent results,
as observed in AtOLE1, revealing conserved functions between GmOLEO1 and AtOLE1 in
increasing oil accumulation. Despite being rarely studied in other species, thehigh similarity
in amino acid sequence and structural domains (Fig 2A and 2B) suggests that GmOLEO1-like
proteins from the Faboideae, Brassicaceae, and grass clades might have a conserved function
in determining OB size but lineage-specific roles [7]. For example, expression of GmOLEO1

correlated with oil content in our study, and OE seeds with increased oil content contained
smaller OBs; conversely, the expression ofoleosin genes was independent of oil content in
maize, and a high-oil maize strain contained larger, more spherical OBs than did low-oil maize
[40]. The conserved role of OLEOS from various plant species in enhancing oil accumulation
suggests that GmOLEO1 orthologs have considerable potential for oil improvement in other
oil-producing crops.
Ithas been demonstrated that oleosins have important functions in OB formation, stabiliza-
tion, and transgenic addition of oleosin increased oil content in Arabidopsis, Brassica and
yeast [10, 31, 41-42], but oleosins' role in increasing oilaccumulation in soybean seeds has
rarely been reported previously. In addition to these potentially cross-species functions in
determining the size ofOBs and affecting oil accumulation, our study showed that increased
oleosins resulted in apparent reductions in OB size and increases in OB number in seed cells
(Fig 6) and increased seed oil contents (Fig 2), in agreement with a study in which suppression
ofOLEO1 resulted in larger OBs and reduced total lipidlevels in seeds [9-10]. Oil accumula-
tion was gradually regulated as the seeds matured, possibly due to a gradual increase in the
expression ofGmOLE01, which was concomitant with the enhanced TAG metabolism during
seed maturation identified by RNA-Seq (Fig 7). Thus, it is logical that a positive correlation
between oil content and GmOLEO1 expression was observed in our study (Fig 1G). A similar
correlation has also been observed in Brassica napus, where the expression levels of fOLEOI
oleosin in high-oil genotypes were considerably higher than those in low-oil seeds [41]. The
higher expression levels ofGmOLEO1 in high-oil soybean varieties might be attributed to the
unique variation present in the promoter ofHapl. The presence of putative seed-maturation-
related cis-elements (abscisic acid (ABA) response and seed regulation, Fig 1F) in the pro-
moter region of GmOLEO1 may be responsible for its exclusive expression during seed
maturation.
In addition to stabilizing the structures oflipid droplets (LDs), oleosins also serve other
functions, including enzymatic and signaling roles. Some ofthese proteins are ubiquitous in
cells with and without LDs, thus exerting broader functions in seeds and other organs [43]. In
peanut, oleosin3 (OLE3) was shown to exhibit bifunctional activities and was phosphorylated
by STYK (AhSTYK) to regulate MGAT and PLA2 activity; it could be involved in the biosyn-
thesis and mobilization ofTAGS during seed maturation and germination [44]. However, a
recent report showed that the bifunctional enzymic motifs are present in only peanut oleosins
and not in those ofother plants [7]; thus, another possibility is that oil accumulation increases
as a result of GmOLEO1 overexpression, which mightlead to efficient feedback by producing
smaller OBs [45]. The detailed mechanisms underlying the regulation of gene expression by
GmOLE1 must be decipheredin future work.
The level ofoleosin itselfis regulated during seed development and germination. When
seeds germinate, oleosin degradation occurs prior to OB degradation. A recent study revealed
that the ubiquitin binding protein PUX10 and division cycle 48 homolog A (CDC48A) are
core components of an LD-associated ERAD-like degradation machinery, which facilitates the
dislocation of oleosins from LDs [46-47]. In our study, faster seed germination ofOE lines
might be associated with higher levels of some olcosin-degradation proteins (e.g., PUX10 and
CDC48A) [46-47], but this hypothesis remains to be experimentally determined.
Based on the results ofour preliminary study and a previous finding [9], we proposed that
the biosynthesis ofTAGs was enhanced in the OE lines, possibly because ofthe affected TAG
metabolic pathway, as a result ofincreased expression ofGmOLEOloleosins Smaller OBs
gradually accumulated as the newly produced TAGS reached the minimum size that couldbe
completely covered by the increased number of oleosin proteins, given that oleosins serve as
surfactant to prevent OBs from coalescence [10, 48]. Thus, increased oleosin production in OE

seeds, which resulted in reduced size but increased turnover ofOBs during seed maturation,
couldbe a more efficient way to use the limited intracellular space than larger OBs, leading to
increased total oil content in OE seeds.
Material and methods
Plant materials and field experiments
The association panel for GWAS consisted of fa diverse collection of219 soybean accessions
(including 195 landraces and 24 elite varieties) originating from 26 provinces across six differ-
ent agroecological regions in China, ranging from latitudes 53to 24°N and longitudes 134 to
97'E [49]. Field experiments were performed in the 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 growing
seasons at four different geographic locations as previously described [50]. Briefly, soybean
plants were examined under field conditions at the following experimental stations: Jiangpu
Experimental Station ofNanjing Agricultural University (32.1'N 118.4'E), Nanjing, in 2009
(designated as Environment 1, E1); Maozhuang Experimental Station (34.8°N 113.6°E) of
Henan Agricultural University Zhengzhou, in 2009 (E2) and 12011 (E3); the Fangcheng Experi-
mental Farm (33.2'N 112.9E) ofHenan Agricultural University in 2012 (E4), and Yuanyang
Experimental Station ofHenan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Zhengzhou, in 2013 (E5)
and in 2014 (E6). A randomized block design was used for all field trials. In all environments,
each accession was planted in a three-row plot, with each row 200 cm long and 50-cm row
spacing.
Phenotyping and genotyping
Mature soybean seeds were harvested and air-dried, and fully filled seeds were used for oil con-
tent measurement. Measurement of soybean oil, protein, and FA components was conducted
using a near infraredspectrophotometer (NIR) seed analyzer (DA7200, Perten Instruments,
Huddinge, Sweden) as previously described [51]. This association panel was genotyped using
the NJAU 355K SoySNP array as previously described [26], and a total of 292,035 high-quality
SNPS were used for association mapping.
Phenotyping analysis
Phenotypic data for soybean seed oil across different environments were subjected to an
ANOVA using the PROC GLM (general linear model) mixed model of fSAS version 9.2 (SAS
Institute, 2002). The linear statistical model includes the effects of genotype, environment and
the environment x genotype interaction. The BLUP for each line was calculated with PROC
MIXED in SAS (SAS Institute, 2002) and used as the phenotypic input for the subsequent
GWAS. The violin plot was drawn using the R package vioplot [52]. The heritability of oil con-
tent was calculated using h = Vg/ (Vg+Ve), where Vg and Ve represent genetic and environ-
mental variation, and each term was extracted from the ANOVA results.
Genome-wide association study
GWAS was conducted using the compressed mixed linear model with TASSEL 5.0 [53, 54]
using SNP with minor allele frequency greater than 0.05, and the threshold was determined
with Bonferroni threshold of < 4.95 X 10-6 (P = 1/n) [55], where n is the SNP number used in
GWAS. The population structure and the relatedness were described previously [26]. The
Manhattan plot was drown using the R package qqman [56]. The LD heat map was plotted
using the LDheatmap R package [57].

GmOLEOtincreases soybean seed oil accumulation
Quantitative real-time PCR
Expression ofthe candidate gene was examined in different soybean tissues, including roots,
shoots, leaves, flowers, pods, and developing seeds at different developmental stages (10, 20,
25, 30 and 40 days after flowering). Total RNA was isolated from the tissues using the RNA-
simple Total RNA Kit (TaKaRa, Japan), and 11 ug ofRNA was treated with 10 units of RNase-
free DNase I (TaKaRa) prior to CDNA synthesis. The first strand ofcDNA was synthesized
using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, USA) following the manu-
facturer's instructions. Gene expression was determined using the Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch
Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad, California, USA). The PCRs contained 5 uL ofthe first-
strand cDNA, 0.5 UL of 10 umolL-1 gene-specific primers (S11 Table), and 10 uL of Real-
Time PCR SYBR Mix (PC3302; Aidlab). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94'C for 3 min
and 40 cycles at 94°C for 15 sand 60°Cfor 15 S. The soybean tubulin gene (GenBank:
AY907703.1) was amplified as an internal reference, and la negative control reaction was per-
formed using water instead of cDNA. Three biological replicates per sample were used, and
each reaction was performed in triplicate.
Dual luciferase assay
In the protoplast transient expression experiments, the dual luciferase assay vector pGreenll
0800-LUC was used to analyze the activity ofthe different promoters. This vector contains a
firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter gene that can be driven by the target promoter and a Renilla
luciferase (REN) reporter gene driven by 35S. The purified DNA fragment ofthe target pro-
moter was fused with the LUC reporter gene in the vector digested with HindIII and Sall
enzymes to construct the recombinant vector. The vector pGreenll 0800-LUC without pro-
moter insertion before the LUC reporter gene was used as acontrol. The recombinant vector
and the control were individually transformed linto Arabidopsis protoplasts via PEG-calcium
transfection. The isolation ofArabidopsis protoplasts and protoplast culture were performed
according to standard protocols [58]. The ratio ofLUC and REN activity (LUC/REN) was
used to reflect the activity ofthe target promoter. The LUC/REN value was determined using
the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, USA).
Vector construction and generation of transgenic plants
The complete coding sequence of GmOLEO1 was amplified from the CDNA ofWilliams 82 by
regular PCR using gene-specific primers (S11 Table). The PCR product was subcloned linto the
pMD-19 T vector (TaKaRa, Japan) for sequence verification. The verified GmOLEO1 sequence
was then cloned into the dicotyledon expression vector PCAMBIA3300, which contains a
selection marker gene, phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (bar), using the ClonExpress Entry
One Step Cloning Kit. The resulting recombinant PCAMBIA33_GMOLEOI construct was
transformed into Williams 82 via the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated soybean cotyledon
node transformation system as previously described [59]. Extraction of genomic DNA from
the leaves of PPT-resistant plants and nontransformed plants was performed using the cetyltri-
methylammonium bromide (CTAB) method [60]. Transformants were verified by leaf-paint
ing assay with herbicide phosphinothricin (PPT), PCR analysis for the presence ofintroduced
GmOLEO1 and bar (482 bp), and LibertyLink strip detection for the expression ofthe bar gene
using the QuickStix Kit (EnviroLogix Inc., ME, USA) were considered positive transgenics for
further analysis. For LibertyLink strip detection, a total of 100 mg leaftissue was collected and
ground completely in the bottom ofa conically tapered 1.5 ml tube by pestle rotation, followed
by adding 0.5 mL ofextraction buffer and la strip into the tube. After ten minutes, strips

containing only the controlline were negative for PAT protein expression, while those with
two lines (controlline and test line) were positive for PAT protein expression [61].
Subcellular localization and colocalization assay
The full-length GmOLEO1 CDNA was amplified and cloned into the pBWA (V)HS-osgfp vec-
tor to obtain the pBWA(VHS-osgfp-355GmOLEOI-GFP construct under control of fthe cau-
liflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter (Biorun Co., Ltd). The binary vector 35S::
GmOLEO1-GFP was transiently coexpressed in the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana via agro-
infiltration. Then, the tobacco leafepidermal cells agro-infiltrated with the GmOLEO1-GFP
construct were stained with Nile Red, a lipophilic dye used to visualize OBs [4]. Fresh leaves
were placed lin a solution containing Nile Red stock (100 mg/mL dimethyl sulfoxide) diluted
100x with 1xPBS for 10 min and washed with PBS twice for 30 s each time. Fluorescence sig-
nals were detected using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon C2-ER, Japan) 2-3 days
after infiltration. GFP, mKate and Nile Red were excited at 488, 561 and 559 nm, and their
emission was detected at 510 to 540, 580 to 620 and 570 to 670 nm, respectively. All ofthese
fluorescence experiments were independently repeated at least three times.
Western blot analysis for GmOLEO1
Immunogenicity peptides ofGmOLEO1 protein were predicted by bioinformatics analysis.
The sequences ofthe peptides were as follows: MAELHYQQQHOYPHR and KDYGQQ-
QISGVQAS. The peptides were commercially synthesized and purified (Wuhan GeneCreate
Biological Engineering Co., Ltd, China). Two male Japanese White rabbits were used for the
immune procedure. Next, a polyclonal antibody of GmOLEO1 protein was separated and
purified for immunoblot analysis. Proteins offresh soybean seed were extracted by Triton X-
100 lysate (0.5%). Then, 30 ug ofprotein extracts mingling with 2x SDS-PAGE sample loading
buffer (Solarbio, Beijing, China) were loaded and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Afterward, protein
bands were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVF) membranes (Solarbio, Beijing,
China). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk powder solution for 2h at room
temperature, followed by incubation with a polyclonal antibody against GmOLEO1 diluted to
1:10000 in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4'C. Finally, the blot was detected with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, USA) for another 1h. The protein bands were visualized using a chemilumi-
nescence system (Pierce, Rockford, Illinois, USA).
RNA-seq analysis of transgenic soybean
Transcriptomes were compared between pooled OE seeds at 20, 25, and 40 DAF, respectively,
with the WT seeds at the corresponding developmental stage. For each time point, two devel-
oping seeds from each ofthe three OE lines (OE-9, -16 and -18) were collected and pooled las
onel biological replicate, and three biological replicates were used per sample. Library construc-
tion was performed as previously described [62]. The library was sequenced with the Illumina
HiSeq 2500 analyzer at Biomarker Technologies (Beijing, China), producing 200-bp paired-
end reads. An average of6.47 gigabases of clean data per sample was generated. Differential
gene expression was determined using the DESeq R package [52]. A gene with an adjusted
P < 0.05 and a fold change (FC) >1.5 were defined as DEGS. Enrichment analysis ofGene
Ontology ofbiological pathways (GOBPS) was performed using the GOseq R packages [63] to
compute P values that indicate the significance of feach GOBP being represented by the genes.
GOBPS with P < 0.01 were identified as enriched biological processes.

Microscopy analysis
Fresh immature soybean seeds harvested at 25 and 40 DAF were fixed in FAA fixation solution
for at least 24 h. The main experimental steps for Oil Red O staining are as follows: cutting the
whole sample into small blocks, removing excess water with tissue paper, immersing the small
tissue blocks in Oil Red O (Servicebio, G1016, Wuhan, China) solution and incubating at 37'C
for 60 min. Excess staining solution was removedby rinsing with tap water. The stained tissue
blocks were immersed in 75% ethanol for 30 min oruntil no fading occurred; then, they were
preserved in 4% paraformaldehyde and kept in the dark. Photos were taken using a digital
camera (Canon 7D). The fixed tissue samples were embedded with OCT compound (Sakura,
Japan). Frozen sections (8-10 uum) were obtained with Cryostat Microtome (Thermo, CRYOS-
TAR NX50, USA) and mounted on a prechilled glass slide. The frozen sections were stained
with 0.1% Nile Red (Servicebio, G1073, Wuhan, China) and Oil Red O (Servicebio, G1016,
Wuhan, China). Image observation for Nile red staining was performed using a Nikon confo-
cal scanning microscope (Nikon, C2, Japan). The excitation wavelength was 488 nm, the emis-
sion wavelengths were 593-654 nm, and the OBs were imaged at 800x magnification. Oil Red
O staining was imaged using an opticalmicroscope (Nikon, Eclipse Ci, Japan) at 800x
magnification.
Tissues (1x3 mm3 in size) ofdeveloping soybean seeds were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde
buffered with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 12 h. Postfixation was subsequently con-
ducted in 1% osmic acid in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 5h. The blocks were then
washed, dehydrated through an ethanol series of 30-100%, and embedded in EMbed 812
media. The samples were cut into 1 um slices using an ultramicrotome (Leica UC7, Germany),
stained with alkaline toluidine blue O solution (Servicebio, G1032, Wuhan, China), and then
imaged (800x) using an optical microscope (Nikon, Eclipse Ci, Japan). For transmission elec-
tron microscopy (TEM), the samples were cut into 60 nm slices using an ultramicrotome
(Leica UC7, Germany) and then separately stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for 15
min. The slice samples were photographed under a TEM (HT7700, Hitachi, Japan).
Gene resequencing and haplotype analysis of GmOLEO1
The 2.3-kb genomic region spanning from 1,500bp upstream from the translation start codon
(ATG) to the 3-untranslated region (UTR) of GmOLEO1 was sequenced and analyzed. Haplo-
type analysis was performed by resequencing this region in 20 high-oil, 20 low-oil and 10 mod-
erate- -oilaccessions. All primers (S11 Table) used in this study were designed using the Primer
3 online tool (http./frodo.wi.mitedu/primer30. All sequences were verified manually, and all
observed polymorphisms were reverified lby resequencing of another amplicon. Allthe verified
sequences were aligned using ClustalX version 1.83 [64]. The polymorphism data were ana-
lyzed using DnaSP version 4.10 [65] to identify sequence variation. Prediction of cis-elements
in the promoter region was carried out using the online web tool PlantCARE [66].
Fatty acid component analysis
FA components in soybean seeds were analyzed as previously described [17]. Briefly, 10 mg
fine powder of soybean seeds was used for FA isolation. FAs were extracted with 1 mL of
extraction buffer (2.5% [v/v] H2SO4 in CH3OH) at 85'Cfor 1h. The supernatant (500 UL) was
mixed with 300 uL ofhexane and 600 uL of0.9% (w/v) NaCl. FA methyl lesters were redis-
solved in 200 uL of ethyl acetate and analyzed immediately with a gas chromatography system
(GC-2014; Shimadzu, Beijing, China). Peaks corresponding to each FA species were identified
by comparison to a FA methyl ester analytical standard (Supelco, Poole, UK). Concentrations

ofFA species were normalized against the internal controlheptadecanoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA). Five biological replicates per line were analyzed in this experiment.
Germination test
The seeds were surface-sterilized with chlorine gas for 4h prior to germination in darkness in
Petri dishes (90 mm in diameter) on two sheets offilter paper moistened with deionized water
(15 seeds per Petri dish). Germination tests were carried out in an incubator (MGC-400B,
YIHENG, Shanghai, China) equipped at 25'Cwith 75% humidity. The filter paper was
replaced once a day, and germinated seeds with healthy roots were counted. Root length was
measured using a ruler at 2, 3 and 7 days postgermination. Three replicates per treatment were
performed.
Gene diversity analysis
The published whole genome sequencing data were used for gene diversity analysis [25].
VCFtools was used to estimate gene diversity (Fst, nucleotide diversity (t) and Tajima'sD)
[67]. SNPRelate combined with APE was used to construct the phylogenetic tree [68, 69].
