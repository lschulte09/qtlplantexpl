Abstract
Background: Soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines 1) is a major pest of soybean
worldwide. The most effective strategy to control this pest involves the use of resistant cultivars. The aim of the
present study was to investigate the genome-wide genetic architecture of resistance to SCN HG Type 2.5.7 (race 1)
in landrace and elite cultivated soybeans.
Results: A total of 200 diverse soybean accessions were screened for resistance to SCN HG Type 2.5.7 and
genotyped through sequencing using the Specific Locus Amplified Fragment Sequencing (SLAF-seq) approach with
a 6.14-fold average sequencing depth. A total of 33,194 SNPS were identified with minor allele frequencies (MAF)
over 4%, covering 97% of all the genotypes. Genome-wide association mapping (GWAS) revealed thirteen SNPS
associated with resistance to SCN HG Type 2.5.7. These SNPS were distributed on five chromosomes (Chr), including
Chr7, 8, 14, 15 and 18. Four SNPS were novel resistance loci and nine SNPS were located near known QTL. A total of
30 genes were identified as candidate genes underlying SCN resistance.
Conclusions: A total of sixteen novel soybean accessions were identified with significant resistance to HG Type 2.5.
7. The beneficial alleles and candidate genes identified by GWAS might be valuable for improving marker-assisted
breeding efficiency and exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying SCN resistance.
