Abstract
Background: The CCCH zinc finger (zf_CCCH) is a unique subfamily featured one or more zinc finger motif(s)
comprising of three Cys and one His residues. The zf_CCCH family have been reported involving in various
processes of plant development and adaptation.
Results: In this study, the zf_CCCH genes were identified via a genome-wide search and were systematically
analyzed. 116 Gmzf_CCCHs were obtained and classified into seventeen subfamilies. Gene duplication and expansion
analysis showed that tandem and segmental duplications contributed to the expansion of the Gmzf_CCCH gene
family, and that segmental duplication play the main role. The expression patterns of Gmzf_CCCH genes were tissue-
specific. Eleven domesticated genes were detected involved in the regulation of seed oil and protein synthesis as well
as growth and development of soybean through GWAS and haplotype analysis for Gmzf_CCCH genes among the 164
of 302 soybeans resequencing data. Among which, 8 genes play an important role in the synthesis of seed oil or fatty
acid, and the frequency of their elite haplotypes changes significantly among wild, landrace and improved cultivars,
indicating that they have been strongly selected in the process of soybean domestication.
Conclusions: This study provides a scientific foundation for the comprehensive understanding, future cloning and
functional studies of Gmzf_CCCH genes in soybean, meanwhile, it was also helpful for the improvement of soybean
with high oil content.
