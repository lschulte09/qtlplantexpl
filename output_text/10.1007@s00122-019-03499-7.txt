Abstract
Key message We explored the genetic basis of SNF-related traits through GWAS and identified 40 candidate genes.
This study provides fundamental insights into SNF-related traits and will accelerate efforts for SNF breeding.
Abstract Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) increases sustainability by supplying biological nitrogen for crops to enhance
yields without damaging the ecosystem. A better understanding ofthis complex biological process is critical for addressing
the triple challenges of food security, environmental degradation, and climate change. Soybean plants, the most important
legume worldwide, can form amutualistic interaction with specialized soil bacteria, bradyrhizobia, to fix atmospheric nitro-
gen. Here we report a comprehensive genome-wide association study of 11 SNF-related traits using 79K GBS-derived SNPS
in 297 African soybeans. We identified 25 QTL regions encompassing 40 putative candidate genes for SNF-related traits
including 20 genes with no prior known role in SNF. A line with a large deletion (164 kb), encompassing a QTL region con-
taining a strong candidate gene (CASTOR), exhibited a marked decrease in SNF. This study performed on African soybean
lines provides fundamental insights into SNF-related traits and yielded a rich catalog of candidate genes for SNF-related
traits that might accelerate future efforts aimed at sustainable agriculture.
