one ofthe most economically important cultivated legumes worldwide. The value ofbiofuel
made from soybean was reported to exceed 1$35 billion in the United States (www.soystats.
com). Increase in need for soybean production has been significant [2]. This requires the use
ofhigh-yielding soybean cultivars and the expansion of croplands for soybean cultivation.
However, soybean production has been constrained lby various factors. Soybean cyst nema-
tode, Heterodera glycines Ichinohe, has been one ofthe most devastating biotic stresses affect-
ing soybean production worldwide. Costs associated with soybean production loss due to SCN
have exceeded $1.5 billion in the U.S. alone [3].
The soybean cyst nematode (SCN) is an obligate parasite andhas been foundin the most
soybean-producing areas in the U.S. [4]. SCN feeds on soybean roots and uses soybean plants
as a carbon source. This will cause a decrease in soybean biomass and suppress soybean yield
[5]. SCN is difficult to control upon establishment in fields. One ofthe most effective ways to
manage SCN is the use ofSCN-resistant soybean cultivars and a non-host plant during crop
rotation [6]. Therefore, developing new SCN-resistant soybean cultivars through breeding is
of fgreat importance.
Breeding for new SCN-resistant soybean cultivars requires a better understanding ofthe
genetic mechanism conferring SCN resistance. A total of 216 QTLs in soybean have been identi-
fied to confer resistance to SCN (www.soybase.org). Ofwhich, two loci were extensively investi-
gated. These two loci consisted ofrhgl and Rhg4, which were mapped on chromosomes 18 and
8, respectively [7]. The soybean cultivar 'Forest' harbored both SCN-resistant QTLS, and Rhg4 is
dominant [8]. This resistance comes from the Peking accession. The second type of resistance
only requires rhgl and this type of resistance comes from PI 88788 [9]. The Rhg4 locus con-
tained a gene encoding for a serine hydroxymethytransferase [10], whereas the genes within
the rhgl locus encoded for an amino acidtransporter, an a-soluble Nethyimalcimide-sensitive
factor attachment protein (a-SNAP), and a wound-inducible domain protein (WI12) [11].
The development of cultivars enhanced with disease resistance has been time-efficiently
achieved thanks to the use ofmolecular markers via marker-assisted selection (MAS) [12]. With
the recent development ofhigh-throughput sequencing technology, tools such as genome-wide
association study (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) have been proven to be powerful for
investigating the genetic architecture ofcomplex traits [13]. Previous studies demonstrated that
GWAS can be used to efficiently identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers asso-
ciated with SCN resistance in soybean. A total of7 SNP markers were reported to be associated
with resistance to SCN HG type 0 using GWAS [14]. In addition, two new candidate genes,
FGAM1 and Glyma18g46201, were identified to be associated with SCN resistance [14]. In
another GWAS,a total of440 soybean accessions were phenotyped for resistance to SCN HG
type Oand HG type 1.2.3.5.7,and 19 SNP markers were shown to be associated with SCN resis-
tance [15]. In addition, a GWAS conducted on a panel consisting of 553 soybean accessions
identified a total of8 new loci contributing to resistance to SCN [16]. Predictive breeding using
genomic selection has brought considerable attention over the past few years. Genomic selec-
tion (GS) was reported to be more efficient over marker-assisted selection (MAS) for SCN resis-
tance in soybean [14]. The earliest GS study for SCN resistance suggested an accuracy in the
range of0.59 to 0.67 for predicting SCN resistance in soybean [14].
The current commercial U.S. soybean cultivars have a narrow genetic background [1]. Due
to this narrow genetic background, the current soybean germplasm would be vulnerable to
nematode infestation [7, 17]. This could be addressedby diversifying the source ofresistance

to nematodes and by investigating potential new loci conferring SCN resistance. Evaluating
tolerance index based on biomass reduction under SCN infestation and characterizing loci
affecting such trait could lead to a new approach for breeding SCN tolerance in soybean.
Therefore, the objectives ofthis study were (i) to conduct GWAS for tolerance ofsoybean bio-
mass to SCN infection, (ii) to identify SNP markers associated with SCN tolerance based on
decrease in plant biomass, and (iii) to perform GS for soybean toleranceto SCN. The trait of
SCN tolerance is different from the trait ofSCN resistance in that a tolerant soybean can sup-
port good SCN reproduction but suffer little damage from the SCN infection, while SCN-resis-
tant soybean does not support SCN reproduction.
Materials and methods
Plant materials and phenotyping
The association panel investigated in this study consisted of 234 soybean accessions (S1 Table)
from the panel of 288 lines used for a previous GWAS ofSCN resistance [14]. A large number
ofthese accessions were selection from the University ofMinnesota soybean breeding pro-
gram and 9 were Plant Introductions (PIs). Ten lines ofthe panel were resistant and 6 lines
were moderately resistant to SCN HG Type 0 (race 3) with the resistance from PI 88788
(rhg1). 'MN0095 was used as a susceptible check and la few lines derived from PI 88788 har-
boring SCN-resistant genes were used as resistant checks [14, 18].
SCN phenotyping was carried out in the greenhouse ofthe University ofMinnesota St. Paul
campus. Soil without SCN infestation collected from a soybean field was mixed with sand at a
2:1 ratio, and 1.5 kg ofthe soil-sand mixture was placed in 1-galon plastic bags. The natural
field soil rather than the sterilized soil was usedbecause the data from the natural field soil
would be better for extrapolating the results to the field setting. Particularly, we considered the
importance ofrhizobium for the soybean growth, and the natural field soil can support suffi-
cient rhizobium development. The soil from each bag was used in one 16-cm-diam clay pot.
Soybean cyst nematode HG Type 1.2.3.5.6.7 (race 4), which can reproduce well on the lines
containing resistance genes from PI 88788, was used. The SCN eggs at a density of 10,000
eggs/100 cm3 of soil and diluted into 10 ml water were added linto the soil in each SCN pot.
Ten soybean seeds were placed on the surface each pot and the seeds were covered with the
remaining soil. Four replicated pots were included for each soybean accession in both SCN
and no-SCN treatments. The two pots (SCN and no-SCN) of the same soybean line were
placed together to minimize the environmental difference between the SCN and no-SCN treat-
ments within a genotype. Due to the large number oflines and limitation ofthe space ofthe
greenhouse, this experiment was conducted at four different times with approximately 60 lines
per time in the same greenhouse. Although lines of each replicate were arranged in a random-
izedblock (S1 and S2 Figs), the experiment was considered complete randomized design
because the lines were evaluated in four groups at four different times. The distances between
each two pots were about 10 cm (S2 Fig).
After 5 days, the plants were thinned to provide five plants per pot. At 65 days after plant-
ing, the average total dry shoot biomass ofthe five plants in each pot under non-SCN infesta-
tion or with SCN infestation was measured. Tolerance index for biomass was computed using
the following formula [19].
Tolerance Index (TI) = 100 X (Biomass under SCN infestation/Biomass without SCN
infestation)
TI values were adjusted to that of'MN0095, used as susceptible controls, in order to mini-
mize environmental effects within and between runs. In each run, there were two sets of
"MN0095' pots with total of8 pairs of fpots inoculated with SCN or not inoculated.

TI_adjusted == TIX (Average TIfor 'MN0095 between runs/Average TI for MN0095'
within each run) with average TI for 'MN0095 between runs/average TI for "MN0095 within
each run being the adjustment coefficient. There were a total of936 TI data points (234 soy-
bean lines x 4 replicates). ANOVA on TI_adjusted values was performed using PROC MIXED
ofSASv.9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Mean separation was conducted using a pro-
tected LSD procedure at a significance level a == 0.05. The statistical model for ANOVA analy-
sis was described as following.
Y, = R, + G + Ej with i = 1,2,3 andj = 1, 234
where Yj denoted the observation on the jth genotype from the ith run, R; represented the effect
ofthe ith replication (random effect), G; was the effect ofthe jth soybean accession (fixed effect),
and ej was the random error associated with the ijth observation. Broad sense heritability was
calculated using H2 = 100 x (0? glo? p/ = 100 X 07p/l0? + (0/r)] [20] where d's was the geno-
typic variance (o's = MSGenotype-MSEror), 0 denoted the total phenotypic variance, 0
was the variance associated with the random error, and r represented the number of replica-
tions. Graph showing the data distribution was drawn using JMPR oGenomics 9 (SAS Insti-
tute, Cary, NC).
Genotyping and quality control
The soybean panel was genotyped using the Soy6K SNP Infinium Chips (ittps/www.soybase.
orgismps/downloadphp) DNA was extracted from young leaves ofeach accession using DNeasy
96 Plant Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). A total of4,251 SNPS were obtained. Ofthe 4,251 SNPS, a
total of3,782 SNPs were maintained after SNP filtering (missing data<15%, heterozygosity<20%,
minor allele frequency>5%). Those high-quality SNPs were used for further analysis.
Genome-wide association study (GWAS) and candidate gene discovery
Genome-wide association study was conducted using TASSEL 5 [21]. A total lof3 GWAS sta-
tistical models were used. These models consisted of single marker regression (SMR), general-
izedlinear model using principal component (PCA) as additional covariate (GLM_(PCA)),
and mixed linear model using principal component (PCA) and Kinship (K) as covariates
(MLM_(PCA+K). The LOD threshold for declaring a significant SNP was 3 [22]. The 50-kb
genomic region containing the significant SNP was used for the candidate gene(s) search.
Functional annotation related to the candidate gene(s) was investigated using Soybase (www.
soybase.org). Candidate genes related to plant defense mechanism were more considered.
SNP selection accuracy and efficiency
SNP selection accuracy and efficiency were computed using the formulas establishedby Shi
et al. [23] as shown below.
Selection accuracy == 100x((Number of genotypes having high tolerance index with the favor-
able SNP allele)/ (Number of genotypes having high tolerance index with the favorable SNP
allele + Number of genotypes having low tolerance index with the favorable SNP allele)].
Selection efficiency = 100x[(Number of genotypes having high tolerance index with the
favorable SNP allele)/(Total number of genotypes having the favorable SNP allele)].
The top 78 SCN-resistant soybean genotypes (one-third ofthe whole panel) were the geno-
types having high tolerance index, whereas the 78 least performing genotypes (one-third ofthe
whole panel) had low tolerance index.

Genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVS) and genomic selection
accuracy assessment
Genomic estimated breeding values were computed under 5 different genomic selection mod-
els: ridge regression best linear unbiased predictor (rrBLUP) [24], genomic best linear unbi-
ased predictor (gBLUP) [25], Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
(Bayesian LASSO) [26], random forest [27], and support vector machines (SVMS) [28]. The
packages 'rrBLUP' [29], GAPIT [30], 'BGLR' [31], 'randomForest [32], and "kernlab' [33]
were used and run in R to perform the genomic selection models rrBLUP, gBLUP, Bayesian
LASSO,random forest, and SVMS, respectively. The posterior distribution ofthe parameter in
the Bayesian LASSO model was Double Exponential and the prior distributions were Uniform
and Inverse Chi-Square for the hypoparameters A and loe Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) iteration and the burin were set to 5,000 and 1,000, respectively, when running the
Bayesian LASSO model [34]. Random forest was achieved using a total of 500 trees and 14
branches for each tree as previously described [14]. The SVMs model was done using a Gauss-
ian kernel function [33].
In order to assess the effect of population training size on genomic selection accuracy oftol-
erance index based on biomass reduction under SCN infestation, cross-validation was con-
ducted at differentlevels. In this study, we have performed a 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold,
6-fold, and 7-fold cross-validation corresponding to a training population size of117, 156,
176, 187, 195, and 201 individuals, respectively. A total of100 replications were conducted at
each level of cross-validation. Genomic selection was conducted using all filtered SNPs and the
selected SNPs from GWAS under the single marker model (SMR SNPS), the generalized lin-
ear model (GLM PCA_SNPs), and the mixed linear model (MLMLPCA_KSNPS, respec-
tively. In order to better fit the genomic selection model when the GWAS-derived SNPS were
used, the number of covariates (SNPS) was increased by choosing the SNPS with LOD greater
than 2 instead lof3. Fewer SNPs incorporated into the models would result in poorly fitted
genomic selection models. Genomic selection accuracy was estimated by evaluating the Pear-
son's correlation coefficientbetween the GEBVS and the observed phenotypes in the testing
set [35].
Results
Phenotyping
Adjusted tolerance index for biomass reduction for the 234 soybean accessions was approxi-
mately normally distributed (Fig 1). The tolerance index was used to measure the level oftoler-
ance of soybean to the SCN infection. The higher the index was, the more tolerant to SCN
infection the genotype was.
Adjusted tolerance index varied from 22.87 to 118.16, with an average of63.80 and a stan-
dard deviation of17.03 (S1 Table). The analysis ofvariance (ANOVA) indicated that adjusted
tolerance index was statistically significantly different among the soybean accessions (F
value == 3.35.p-valuec0.0001) (Table 1). Broad sense heritability was estimated using the vari-
ance components from ANOVA (Table 1). Estimate ofbroad sense heritability for adjusted
tolerance index was high (89.3).
The lowest adjusted tolerance index was recorded for MN0082SP (22.87), PI445799 (27.49),
PI437267 (30.10), PRIDEB216 (30.50), M95228092 (31.88), M95274129 (32.16), L237 (32.43),
M95274114 (33.63), M95227016 (34.50), and M94278001 (35.11) (S1 Table), indicating that
SCN infestation resulted in a significant reduction in biomass for those genotypes, thus intol-
erant to SCN. The genotypes with the highest adjusted tolerance index were GRANDE (98.68),

mass for those accessions, hence they were SCN-tolerant.
SNP profiling
After SNP filtering, a total of3,782 high quality SNPS were used for GWAS. Average number
ofSNPs per chromosome was 189, with chromosome 18 having the highest number of SNPS
(256) and chromosome 11 harboring the lowest number ofSNPs (127) (Table 2). Average dis-
tance between SNP was 255 kb. SNP density was the highest on chromosome 13 with an inter-
SNP distance of181 kb (Table 2). SNPS were most scattered on chromosome 1 with an average
distance of 374kb between SNPs (Table 2). Kinship analysis revealed that the population was
structured into 3 subgroups (S3 Fig), of which, two subgroups had similar size.
Genome-wide association study (GWAS)
Single marker regression (SMR). The single marker regression model indicated latotal of
35 significant SNPs (LOD>3) associated with tolerance index based on biomass reduction
under SCN infestation (Table 3) (Fig 2A). These significant SNPs were scattered across the
soybean genome. The top 5 SNPs with the highest LOD were Gm15_8263547.G_T (LOD =
4.92, MAF = 13.60%), Gm15.8412363.G_A (LOD = 4.85, MAF == 12.89%), Gm19_37932358

However, ifthe marker effects ofthe 5 top SNPs were pooled under an additive model assump-
tion, the effects could account for up to 47% ofthe variation in tolerance index based on bio-
mass reduction.
Ofthe 35 significant SNPs found under the SMR model, 8 were located on a 2-Mb region of
chromosome 15, indicating a strong likelihood ofQTL(s) affecting tolerance index based on
biomass reduction under SCN infestation in this region (Fig 2A). These 8 SNPs consisted of

Chromosome 18 harbored a total 4 significant SNP markers mapped on a 7-Mb genomic
region. These SNPs consisted lofGm18.51128392GA (LOD == 3.37, MAF = 6.86%),

These results indicated that the 7-Mb region of chromosome 18 harboring the aforementioned

GWAS and GS for SCN tolerance
A total of7 significant SNPS were mapped on a 3.5-Mb region of chromosome 15 (Table 3)
(Fig 2B). These SNPS consisted ofGm15.4973977T.CI (LOD = 4.35, MAF == 8.33%),
Gm15_7574118_T.C (LOD = 5.67, MAF == 10.85%), Gm15_7721702G_A (LOD = 3.84,
MAF == 7.48%), Gm15_7864348.G_T (LOD == 4.13, MAF == 8.02%), Gm15_8134735_AG
(LOD = 3.61, MAF = 6.90%), Gm15.826347.G.TLOD == 4.40, MAF = 8.32%), and
Gm15_8412363GA (LOD = 4.31, MAF = 8.23%) (Table 3). A significant portion ofthe
3.5-Mb region ofchromosome 15 containing these significant SNPS overlapped with the 2-Mb
region of chromosome 15 that were indicated by the SMR model, thus increasing the likeli-
hood of significant loci controlling tolerance index based on biomass reduction under SCN
infestation in this genomic region. In addition, chromosome 18 contained a cluster of4 signifi-
cant SNPsmapped on a 740-Kb genomic region (Table3) (Fig 2B). These SNPs consisted of
Gm18.51128392.G_A (LOD == 3.78, MAF = 37.10%), Gm18_51659540AG (LOD = 3.60,
MAF == 35.40%), Gm18_51772288_T.C (LOD == 3.18, MAF == 34.53%), and Gm18_51867289
C_T (LOD == 3.70, MAF = 35.84%) (Table 3). This region of chromosome 18 also significantly
overlapped with that offound with the SMR model.
Mixed linear model (PCA + K). A mixed linear model involving the covariates principal
component (PCA) and Kinship (K) was also conducted in order to identify SNP markers asso-
ciated with tolerance index based on reduction in biomass under SCN infestation in soybean.
As expected, fewer SNPs had an LOD greater than 3 compared to the results obtained from
the SMR and GLM_PCA models. These SNPS were Gm06_11098210C_T (LOD = 3.44,
MAF = 16.67%), Gm15_7574118T.C (LOD == 3.79, MAF = 19.73%), Gm15_7864348G_T
(LOD = 3.09, MAF = 11.21%), Gm15_8263547.G_T (LOD == 3.35, MAF = 13.60%), Gm15_
8412363_G_A (LOD = 3.25, MAF == 12.89%), and Gm19_37932358.CT (LOD = 3.93,
MAF == 18.69%) with R-square values of7.40%, 8.08%, 6.53%, 6.99%, 6.83%, and 19.13%,
respectively (Table 3) (Fig 2C). Chromosome 15 harbored a total of4significant SNPS out of
these 6 SNPs. The 4 SNPs were located on an 840-Kb region ofchromosome 15, which over-
lapped with the significant loci indicated by the SMR and GLM_PCA models (Fig 2C). Since
this region on chromosome 15 was suggested by all 3 statistical models, the likelihood ofhav-
ing QTL(s) affecting is high. Interestingly, no SNPS having an LOD greater than 3 were found
on chromosome 18, unlike the SMR and the GLM_PCA models. Ifthe threshold was 2.60, one
SNP marker located on chromosome 18 wouldbe significant.
Overlapping significant SNP markers between models and candidate genes
The linear regression models upon which the SMR, GLM_PCA, and GLM_PCA_K models
were built had different covariates. Despite this discrepancy between models, the results indi-
cated three consistent genomic regions significantly associated with tolerance index based on
biomass reduction under SCN infestation in soybean (Fig 2). The SNPs Gm06_11098210.CT
(LOD_SMR == 4.66, LOD_GLM_PCA == 3.93, LOD_GLM_PCAK =l 3.44), Gm15_7574118
T_C (LOD_SMR == 4.51, LOD_GLM_PCA == 5.67, LOD_GLM_PCA_K == 3.79), Gm15_
7864348 G_T (LOD_SMR = 4.61, LOD_GLM PCA == 4.13, LOD_GLM_ PCA_K == 3.09),
Gm15_8263547.G_T (LOD_SMR == 4.92, LOD_GLM_PCA == 4.40, LOD_GLM_ PCA_K=
3.35), Gm15.8412363G_A (LOD_SMR = 4.85, LOD_GLM_PCA = 4.31, LOD_GLM_P-
CA_K = 3.25), Gm19.37932358.CT (LOD_SMR == 4.84, LOD_GLM PCA == 4.50, LOD_
GLM_PCA_K == 3.93) had an LOD greater than 3 regardless ofthe model (Table 4). These
results suggested that the regions harboring these SNPS, especially the 840-Kb region ofchro-
mosome 15, had a strong probability of containing QLT(s) affecting tolerance index based on
reduction in biomass under SCN infestation in soybean.

GWAS and GS for SCN tolerance
Since the 6 aforementioned SNPS were consistent across all 3 models, candidate genes in
their vicinity were investigated. These candidate genes consisted of Glyma.06G134900, Gly-
ma.15G097500.1, Glyma.15G1009003, Glyma.15G105400, Glyma.15G107200, and Gly-
ma.19G121200.1 (Table 4). Glyma.06G134900, Glyma.15G097500.1, Glyma.15G1009003,
Glyma.15G105400, and Glyma.19G121200.1 encodedfor smallheat-shock protein (HSP20)
family, mago nashi family protein, protein phosphatase 2C family protein, predicted 3-keto-
sphinganine reductase, and protein FAR1-related sequence 3-like isoform X1, respectively,
whereas no functional annotation was found for Glyma.15G107200 (Table 4). Gly-
ma.18g225800, encoding for a homeobox-leucine zipper protein, was found in the vicinity of
the SNP maker located on chromosome 18 under the mixed liner model (PCA + K).
Selection accuracy and efficiency
Selection accuracy and efficiency for the SNPs overlapping between models were calculated. The
average selection accuracy for the selected SNPS was 43.00% and rangedbetween 40.82% and
48.67% (Table 5). The SNP with thehighest selection accuracy was Gm06_11098210.CT,
whereas the one with the lowest accuracy among the selected SNP was Gm19.37932358.CT.
Selection efficiency varied from 25.33% to 32.74%, with an average of 28.12% and a standard devi-
ation of2.58% (Table 5). The SNP with the highest selection efficiency was Gm06_11098210.CT,
and the one with the lowest selection efficiency was Gm15J754118.T.CCable 5).

random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVMS) (Table 6). Marker effects were eval-
uated from all SNPS and the SNPs obtained from GWAS under single marker regression
(SMR), generalizedlinear model (GLM_(PCA), and mixedlinear model (MLM_(PCA+K))
models, respectively. The effect oftraining population size on genomic selection accuracy was
also investigated by conducting cross-validation at different levels with 100 replications for
each cross-validation fold. Regardless ofthe genomic selection model and the size ofthe train-
ing population, the accuracy of genomic selection was higher when the SNPS obtained from
GWAS were used (Table 6) (Fig 3). Interestingly, the genomic selection accuracy using the sig-
nificant SNPs from SMR was not as high as the one obtained from the other GWAS models
such as GLM (PCA) and MLM (PCA + K) when the gBLUP model was used for conducting
genomic selection (Fig 3). There was not a significant variation in genomic selection accuracy
between the SNP set consisting of fSMR_SNPS, GLM_PCA_SNPs, and MLM_PCA_K_SNPS
for the genomic selection models involving BLR, RF, rrBLUP, and SVMs (Fig 3). Overall,
genomic selection accuracy slightly increased when the training population was bigger and
plateaued out at a 6-fold cross-validation (Table 6) (Fig 3), corresponding to a training popula-
tion size of 195 individuals.
For rrBLUP, genomic selection accuracyincreased to almost 2-fold at each level of cross-
validation when the GWAS-derived SNPs were incorporated into the genomic selection
model. The highest increase was found at 2-fold cross validation where the genomic selection
accuracy was 0.22 when all SNPS were used and was equalto 0.50, 0.50, and 0.51 when the
SNP set SMR_SNP, GLM_PCA_SNP, andMLM_PCAKSNP were used, respectively

Bayesian Lasso regression (BLR), genomic best linear unbiasedpredictor(gBLUP),random forest (RF), ridge regression best linear unbiased predictor

and 7-fold) in order to assess the effect tofpopulation training size on genomic selection accuracy. At teach levelofcros-validation, SNP set consisting ofall
SNPS and SNPS with an LOD greater than 2 based lon the GWAS Son analysis were used for conducting genomic selection. SMR_SNPS denoted the SNPS from
the single marker regression model, GLM_PCA_SNPS represented the SNPs from the generalized linear model, and IMLM_PCAKSNPS corresponded to the
SNPs from the mixed linear model lin GWAS. Box plot color coding in the above figure is SNP set-wise. Genomic selection was conducted using a total of100

using GWAS-derived SNPs increased genomic selection to almost 3-fold expect for the SMR
SNP set (Table 6) (Fig 3). Under the gBLUP model, genomic selection accuracy was the highest
when the GLM_PCA SNP set was used. Genomic selection was 0.43, 0.44, 0.46, 0.48, 0.45, and
0.45 at 2-, 3-,4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-fold cross-validation, respectively, for the GLM PCA SNP set
(Table 6), whereas the accuracy was 0.14, 0.17, 0.16, 0.16, 0.19, 0.18 at 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and
7-fold cross-validation, respectively, when all SNPs were used to perform genomic selection
(Table 6). Genomic selection accuracy performed better under the BLR model than the gBLUP
model. Genomic selection accuracy was more than 0.50 when the GWAS-derived SNPS were
used in the BLR model (Table 6). Unlike the results suggested by gBLUP, genomic selection
under the BLR model showed a higher and a more stable result ifthe SNPs were derived from
a GWAS analysis (Fig 3). The SVMs model resulted in a lower genomic selection accuracy
than BLR and rrBLUP, but was comparable to gBLUP except for the SNPs derived the SMR
modelin GWAS (Fig 3). In addition, the genomic selection based on the SVMS model was spe-
cial in a way that the accuracy was the best when the SNPs from the SMR GWAS model were
used, which was not the case for the other genomic selection models (Table 6) (Fig 3). Among
the 5 genomic selection models used for predicting tolerance index based on biomass reduc-
tion under SCN infestation, the RF model displayed the best accuracy when all SNPS were
used (Table 6). However, the selection accuracy under the RF model was lower than rrBLUP
and BLR when the GWAS-derived SNPs were used (Table 6) (Fig 3). These results suggested
that genomic selection for tolerance index based on biomass reduction under SCN infestation
was model-, SNP set-, and training population size-dependent.

ALTONA, MN1804CN, M97305077, M97304052, M97205096, M98332108, MN1806SP, and
ALPHA was not affectedby SCN infection, indicating that these genotypes were tolerant to
SCN infection. Among the 9 lines, MN1804CN and ALPHA (PI 564524) contained resistance
from PI 88788 and were resistant to HG Type 0 (race 3) [14]; the SCN tolerance in these 2
lines can be due to or partially due to the SCN resistance trait. All other 7lines were susceptible
to race 3 and the SCN population used in this study; the tolerance in these 7lines must be due
to some other traits rather than the traits resistant to SCN development and reproduction. The
results suggest that the SCN tolerance traits based on biomass phenotyping is usefulin diversi-
fying soybean cultivars with SCN tolerance traits (minimizing SCN damage) in additional to
SCN resistance traits (suppressing SCN reproduction).
Genome wide association study (GWAS) has been a powerful tool to identify SCN-resis-
tance loci in soybean [14-16, 36]. A total of3,782 high quality SNPS were used to conduct
GWAS for tolerance index based on biomass reduction under SCN infestation in this study. A
total of 35, 21, and 6 SNPs were identified to be associated with tolerance index based on bio-
mass reduction under SCN infestation using the models SMR, GLM (PCA), and MLM (PCA
+K). Of which, 6 SNPs overlapped between the 3 models. The discrepancy in terms ofthe
number of significant SNPS found from each model was attributed to the different covariates
used upon which each GWAS model was built. PCA accounted for population stratification
within the soybean panel investigated in this study. The SMR model does not account for pop-
ulation structure, GLM (PCA) has the ability to reduce false discovery due to population strati-
fication, and MLM (PCA +K) further decreases false discovery rate by incorporation the
genetic relatedness between soybean lines, which was denoted as Kinship (K). Both SMR and
GLM (PCA) models identified a cluster of significant SNPS found on chromosome 18, which
harbored the resistant tlocus rhgl [9]. A few lines involved in the soybean panel used in this
study were derived from PI 88788 [14], which has the rhgl locus resistant to SCN. The SCN
resistant traits can contribute to soybean tolerance under the SCNinfection, but the rghl
genes have little resistance to the SCN population ofHG Type 1.2.3.5.6.7 (race 4) used in this
study. Interestingly, the highest GWAS signals were located on an 840-Kb region of chromo-
some 15. Ofthe 6 SNPS overlapping between the 3models, 4 were mapped on chromosome
15. To the best of four knowledge, to date, no SCN-resistant locihave been reportedin the
vicinity ofthese SNPs. There were only 16 lines potentially containing SCN resistance ofrhgl
on chromosome 18 from PI 88788. Since the FI ofthe SCN population on PI 88788 was 28.2
and a soybean derived from PI 88788 generally have higher FI than the source, probably none
ofthese 16 soybean lines could have FIless than 30 andbe classified as a soybean resistant to
the SCN population usedin this study. Therefore, this QTL on this chromosome 15 is probably
a sole tolerance trait that promotes soybean growth to minimize biomass reduction by SCN
infection, but is unable to suppress SCN reproduction.
One ofthe most surprising findings reported in this study was the involvement of small
heat-shock protein (HSP20) for SCN tolerance based on biomass reduction. In addition to
conferring resilience to abiotic stresses such as drought andhot temperatures, small-heat
shock proteins (HSP20) have been also suggested to help with plant defense mechanism to
pathogen infection [37]. These proteins act as molecular chaperones by assisting with protein
folding and other post-translational modifications during pathogen invasion. Park and Seo
[37] showed that HSP20 is highly involved in controlling R proteins during plant pathogen
attack. Therefore, there could be a link between HSP20 and lits involvementin limiting damage
ofSCN infection in soybean. However, this finding requires additional validation. Our results
also indicated a mago nashi family protein to be a good candidate for SCN tolerance. Mago
nashi protein is a key component ofthe exon junction complex (EJC) [38]. The involvement
of mago nashi protein in plant defense pathways against pathogens remains poorly

understood. However, Gong et al. [38] reportedthat one ofthe genes found in the EJC com-
plex is involved in plant growth and development. In this study, we reportedloci affecting tol-
erance index based on biomass reduction under SCN infestation in soybean. We could suggest
that the EJC complex might promote plant growth under SCN infestation, resulting in a
greater shoot biomass. A phosphatase 2C family protein has been also found to be associated
with SCNtolerance in this study. This protein belongs to the class of fenzymes requiring Mg?+
and Mn2+ to be functional. These proteins are highly involved in plant signaling pathways dur-
ing pathogen infection [39]. One ofthe pathways involving these proteins that are relevant to
biotic stress is the signaling ofthe hormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulation. Fuchs et al. [39]
described that the regulation of ABA upon plant biotic stress contributes to maintaining vege-
tative growth and modulating plant transpiration. This could explain the factthat some soy-
bean lines used in this study were able to grow and develop under SCN infestation. A
predicted 3-ketosphinganine reductase has also been identified as a potential candidate gene
for tolerance to SCN infection in this study. This protein has been shown to play key roles in
plant response to biotic stress [40]. This protein is an essential element of cell wall and acts as a
hormone signaling molecule [40]. Wang et al. [41] demonstrated that the gene encoding for
3-ketosphinganine reductase is upregulated during powdery mildew infection in Arabidopsis
thaliana. This molecule is significantly involved in the salicylic-acid pathway [41]. Even
though no reports have described the direct involvement of 3-ketosphinganine reductase in
SCN defense mechanism, we could still speculate that its mechanism in soybean might be sim-
ilar to the one described during the powdery mildew infection in Arabidopsis thaliana. An
annotated gene, Glyma.19G121200.1, has also been found in the vicinity ofthe significant
SNPs associated with tolerance index based on biomass reduction under SCN infestation. This
gene encodes for FAR1-related sequence 3-like isoform X1. However, to date, there is no
report describing the role ofthis protein in plant defense mechanism against pathogens.
Therefore, further analyses are required to elucidate the unknown functions ofthe proteins
transcribedby the annotated genes found in the vicinity ofthe SNP markers. In addition, fur-
ther studies are needed for validating the candidate genes prior to their deployment into a
marker-assisted selection aiming at improving SCN tolerance in soybean.
Genomic selection has become more and more popular in modern plant breeding [42, 43].
Genomic selection has been proven to be successfulin improving genetic gain per unit oftime
in other studies [35, 44-47]. However, few reports have focused on the potential establishment
ofgenomic selection to unravel the genetic architecture of SCN tolerance in soybean. In this
investigation, we performed genomic selection based on 5 statistical models (BLR, gBLUP,
rrBLUP, RF, and SVMS) and 4 SNP sets (all SNPS, SMR_SNPS, GLM_PCA_SNPS, and
MLMLPCA_K_SNPS, In addition, we have also investigated the effect oftraining population
size on genomic selection accuracy by conducting genomic selection at differentlevels of
cross-validation. Results indicated that genomic selection accuracy was model, SNP set-, and
training population size-dependent. This implies that model selection criteria, type ofSNPs,
population training size are critical components of finterest when conducting a genomic selec-
tion study. Using GWAS-derived SNPS enhanced the accuracy to almost two-fold. A study
conductedby Bao et al. [14] on both association mapping and genomic selection on a total of
282 soybean genotypes for SCN resistance indicated that the use of significant SNPs for con-
ducting genomic selection significantly improved the accuracy of prediction, which was in
agreement with the data reported in this current investigation.
In this study we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify SNP
markers, and to perform a genomic selection (GS) study for soybean tolerance to SCN infec-
tion based on biomass reduction. GWAS has been shown to be successful in studies investigat
ing the genetics ofSCN in soybean [48]. Li et al. [49] mapped a 6-Mb region ofchromosome

15 to be associated with SCN. In this report, this region has been narrowed to aless than 2-Mb
region. In a previous report, we presented the genomic study ofsoybean tolerance to the SCN
infection based on chlorophyll content. Soybean tolerance to SCN may be best characterized
by soybean yield response to the SCN infection [48]. However, due to a large number ofsoy-
bean lines that are needed for the GWAS, it is difficult to conduct a field scale experiment to
phenotype the soybean yield response ofall lines to SCNin the same field under similar envi-
ronmental conditions including the SCN infestation level. The greenhouse experiment is the
first feasible step to conduct genomic study of SCN tolerance. Biomass in the greenhouse can
probably be used to predict yield potential in field, but cautiousness must be taken to extrapo-
late the greenhouse results to the field setting. We realize that there were some limitations in
this greenhouse study. For example, we were unable to conduct the experiment to include all
lines at the same time, so it is possible that there were unknown extraneous environmental fac-
tors that interfered with our data interpretation. Furthermore, the plants within and between
pots appeared to be too crowded for the soybean plants to grow for two months in the green-
house (S2 Fig), and the plant growth ofa line might have affected the plant growth oflines in
the neighbor pots. We took consideration ofthe density of plants per pot and variability ofbio-
mass measurements among replicates; ifnumber ofplants/pot were reduced, it would proba-
bly increase the variability among replicates. It appeared that the plant density of5 plants/pot
was an appropriate design for this study. However, ifthere is sufficient greenhouse space, it
would be better to increase the distance between pots and number of replicates. Nevertheless,
to our knowledge, this is the first study oftolerance QTLs to SCNin soybean, perhaps first
study oftolerance QTLs to any plant-parasitic nematode based on biomass reduction under
nematode infestation. Soybean cyst nematode is mainly managed by using SCN-resistant soy-
bean cultivars, which limit SCN reproduction. SCN-tolerant QTLs may include the QTLs
resistant to SCN reproduction, but some QTLS can only affect plant growth, not SCN develop-
ment and reproduction. This study opened la novel approach to diversify genes that promote
plant growth and leveloff the damage causedby SCN infection. With the advances in genome
sequencing and genetic analyses, genomic selection ofSCN-tolerant traits is a promising
approach to breed SCN-tolerant soybean for enhancing SCN management.
Conclusions
This study reported the variation in tolerance index based on biomass reduction of a total of
234 soybean genotypes. To the best ofour knowledge, this is one ofthe a fewreports investi-
gating SCN tolerance in soybean. In addition to confirming previously reportedloci, we iden-
tified new loci ifor SCN tolerance using tolerance index based on biomass reduction.
Moreover, we have showed that genomic selection accuracy for SCN tolerance depends on
various factors such as statistical models, SNP sets, and training population size.
