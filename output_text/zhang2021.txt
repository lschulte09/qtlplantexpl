Abstract
Keymessage We detected a QTL qHSW-16 undergone strong selection associated with seed weight and identified a
novel candidate gene controlling seed weight candidate gene for this major QTL by qRT-PCT.
Abstract Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] provides more than half of the world's oilseed production. To expand its germ-
plasm resources useful for breeding increased yield and oil quality cultivars, it is necessary to resolve the diversity and
evolutionary history of this crop. In this work, we resequenced 283 soybean accessions from China and obtained a large
number of high-quality SNPS for investigation of the population genetics that underpin variation in seed weight and other
agronomic traits. Selective signature analysis detected 78 (-25.0 Mb) and 39 (-22.60 Mb) novel putative selective signals
that were selected during soybean domestication and improvement, respectively. Genome-wide association study (GWAS)
identified five loci associated with seed weight. Among these QTLS, qHSW-16, overlapped with the improvement-selective
region on chromosome 16, suggesting that this QTL may be underwent strong selection during soybean improvement. Of
the 18 candidate genes in qHSW-16, only SoyZH13_16G122400 showed higher expression levels in a large seed variety
compared to a small seed variety during seed development. These results identify SOyZH13_16G122400 as a novel candidate
gene controlling seed weight and provide foundational insights into the molecular targets for breeding improvement of seed
weight and potential seed yield in soybean.
Introduction
Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]is a legume crop that pro-
vides approximately 68% of the world's protein meal and
57% of vegetable oil production. Archaeological and evolu-
