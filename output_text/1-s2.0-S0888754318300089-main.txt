trait loci (QTLS) associated with the seed protein and oil contents. Using specific length amplified fragment
sequencing (SLAF-seq) technology, atotal of12,072 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS) witha minor allele
frequency (MAF) y 0.05 were detected across the 20 chromosomes (Chr), with a marker density of 78.7 kbp. A
total of31 SNPS located on 12of the 20soybean chromosomes were correlated with seed protein and oil content.
Of the 31 SNPS that were associated with the two target traits, 31 beneficial alleles were identified. Two SNP
markers, namely rs15774585 and rs15783346 on Chr 07, were determined to be related to seed oil content both
in 2015 and 2016. Three SNP markers, rs53140888 on Chr 01, rs19485676 on Chr 13, and rs24787338 on Chr
20 were correlated with seed protein content both in 2015 and 2016. These beneficial alleles may potentially
contribute towards the MAS of favorable soybean protein and oil characteristics.
