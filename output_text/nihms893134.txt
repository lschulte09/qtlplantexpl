Abstract
The soybean cyst nematode (SCN) is one of the most destructive pathogens of soybean plants
worldwide. Host-plant resistance is an environmentlly-friendly method to mitigate SCN damage.
To date, the resistant soybean cultivars harbor limited genetic variation, and some are losing
resistance. Thus, a better understanding of the genetic mechanisms of the SCN resistance, as well
as developing diverse resistant soybean cultivars, is urgently needed. In this study, a genome-wide
association study (GWAS) was conducted using 1,032 wild soybean (Glycine soja) accessions
with over 42,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS) to understand the genetic architecture
of G. soja resistance to SCN racel. Ten SNPS were significantly associated with the response to
race 1. Three SNPS on chromosome 18 were localized within the previously identified quantitative
trait loci (QTLS), and two of which were localized within a strong linkage disequilibrium block
encompassing a nucleotide-binding (NB)-ARC disease resistance gene (Glyma.18g102600.
Genes encoding methyltransferases, the calcium-dependent signaling protein, the leucine-rich
repeat kinase family protein, and the NB-ARC disease resistance protein, were identified as
promising candidate genes. The identified SNPs and candidate genes can not only shed light on
the molecular mechanisms underlying SCN resistance, but also can facilitate soybean
improvement employing wild genetic resources.

1. Introduction
SCN is a major pest of soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] worldwide. Soybean plants
infected with SCN exhibit symptoms of root necrosis and stunting underground as well as
leaf chlorosis, early senescence, and seed weight reduction. The soybean production loss
caused by SCN is estimated to cost $1.5 billion annually in the USA, which makes it the
most damaging pest than any other soybean pathogens (Wrather and Koenning 2006). Crop
rotation for multiple years can reduce levels of SCN in the field, but this practice is
I
dependent on the profitability and practicality of the non-host crops. Nematicides are costly
and environmentally harmful. In contrast, the use of resistant soybean cultivars is an
economically and environmentally friendly method of mitigating SCN damage to soybeans.
However, continuous use of cultivars derived from a single genetic source of resistance can
cause the SCN population to evolve to overcome host resistance, thus diminishing the utility
of any given SCN-resistant soybean cultivar.
The first reported case of SCN in North America occurred in North Carolina (Winstead et al.
E
1955), and the pest has since spread through soybean growing areas of the United States.
Thus far, SCN has been found in every soybean-producing state except New York and West
Virginia and continues to spread considerably (Tylka and Marett 2014). Sixteen potential
SCN races have been identified using four different hosts: PI548402 (Peking), PI548988
I
(Pickett), PI88788, and PI90763 (we call this classification scheme as SCN race scheme). A
modified classification scheme was subsequently developed using the H. glycine (HG) type
to characterize a SCN population (Niblack et al. 2003); this scheme is more suitable for
characterizing a heterogeneous SCN population and has been extensively used in classifying
SCN populations. The method uses a panel of seven soybean genotypes (Peking, PI88788,
PI90763, 437654, 209332, PI89772 and PI548316) with varying levels of resistance to SCN
(we call this modified classification scheme as SCN type scheme). Here we use SCN race
scheme because 1) the SCN screening in this study was performed in the year 2000 (prior to
I
the development of SCN type scheme) (Niblack et al. 2002); 2) both race 1 and race 5 have
the same SCN type (HG 2.5.7); 3) the term "race" has been used in soybean-breeding efforts
referring to the SCN population for many decades and it is convenient for comparison. The
SCN originally found in North Carolina was later categorized as race 1 (Golden et al. 1970).
I
Now this race is widely spread in most soybean fields. It has been demonstrated that
cultivated soybeans underwent a severe "genetic bottleneck" (Hyten et al. 2006), and some
of well-used resistant cultivars are loosing resistance due to SCN race shifts (Mitchum et al.
2007; Niblack et al. 2008). It is in urgent needs to explore new sources of SCN resistance in
the wild relatives of soybeans and to develop novel SCN resistant soybean cultivars.
Knowledge of the genetic basis of the soybean-SCN interaction mostly comes from
I
quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
Soybean resistance to SCN is a complex trait involving many genes. To date, at least 40
QTLS from different resistant varieties have been mapped to 17 of 20 chromosomes
(Concibido et al. 2004; Vuong et al. 2010); 14 of these QTLS were associated with race 1
resistance. The identification of two significant loci, rhgl on chromosome 18 and Rhg4on
chromosome 8, has revealed that the copy number variation of three tandem
amino
I
genes (an
acid transporter, an alpha-SNAP, and a wounding-inducible protein 12) and the involvement

of a serine hydroxymethylransferase provide resistance to SCN. Genomic regions
containing or adjacent to these important loci are associated with resistance to multiple races
E
(Yue et al. 2000; Guo et al. 2006; Wu et al. 2009). GWAS is increasingly being used to
identify the genetic basis of complex traits variation in diverse crop species (Li et al. 2013;
Morris et al. 2013). Recent analyses of sudden death syndrome resistance in soybean plants
confirmed 7loci in previously reported QTL intervals and identified 13 novel loci using the
GWAS approach (Wen et al. 2014). Accordingly, GWAS was also applied to scan genomic
regions associated with resistance to SCN races 3 and 4 in cultivated
I
soybean populations
(Han et al. 2015; Vuong et al. 2015). In these and other studies, both known and novel QTLs
were identified, and candidate genes underlying SCN resistance were suggested (Wen et al.
2014; Zhang et al. 2015b). GWA mapping showed a useful complementary approach to
classical bi-parental QTL mapping for dissecting the genetic basis of complex traits
variation.
Crop wild relatives (CWR) have gradually gained attention during the past decade due to
their higher genetic diversity than that of their domesticated decedents.
have
E
CWRs been
extensively studied for identification of genes associated with abiotic and biotic stress
resistance, as well as crop improvement (Zhang et al. 2016a). The wild soybean (Glycine
soja Sieb. & Zucc.) is the closest relative of the cultivated soybean (Glycine max). G. soja
has retained more than half of the genetic diversity that had been lost in the cultivated
I
soybean due to "bottleneck" events during the domestication process (Hyten et al. 2006;
Zhou et al. 2015). Long-term exposure to the combination of various harsh environmental
stresses has led G. soja to possess superior characteristics in abiotic stress tolerance (Qi et al.
2014) and biotic stress resistance (Kim et al. 2011; Tian and Smith 2015). To date, few
studies have used G. soja to identify QTLS for SCN resistance (Kim et al. 2011; Kim and
Diers 2013; Zhang et al. 2016b), whereas no studies have applied high-density SNP markers
I
to understand the genetic architecture of the G. soja response to race 1.
In this study, we evaluated the resistance responses of a set of 1,032 G. soja accessions to (1)
quantify the diversity of the G. soja resistance response to SCN race 1; (2) identify genomic
regions significantly associated with race 1 resistance using the GWAS strategy with
r42,000 genome-side SNPS, and (3) predict candidate genes involved in the G. soja response
I
to race 1 infection.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Wild Soybean Samples and Phenotype
A total of 1,032 G. soja accessions from the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) Soybean Germplasm Collection were used for association analysis in this study
E
(Table S1). This set of G. soja accessions originated from four East Asian countries: Russia,
China, Japan, and South Korea (Figure 1). All these 1,032 accessions were evaluated for
resistance levels to SCN race 1 in the year 2000 by Prakash team. The SCN screening assay
was performed in the greenhouse as described previously (Arelli et al. 2000). Ten seedlings
of each accession were used for SCN inoculation. Peking, Pickett, PI 88788, PI 90763, and
PI 437654 were used as host differentials, with Hutcheson
control.

inoculated with 1200 + 25 eggs in 5 mL distilled water suspension. The resistance level for
each accession was evaluated using female index (FI), which is a percentage of the number
:
offemales produced on each line divided by the number produced on a standard susceptible
soybean, and the result is multiplied by 100. The screening result was retrieved from USDA
website: htps_/trainingan-grin.gov/gringlobal, which was reported using SCN race
scheme (Table S1). We used the term "HG type" when to compare to recently published
results.
I
2.2. Genotype Data and Quality Control
This set of 1,032 G. soja accessions was previously genotyped with the Illumina
SoySNP50k iSelect BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA. USA) and contained a total of
52,041 SNPS (Song et al. 2013; Song et al. 2015). The SNP data for this set of population
are available and can be retrieved from the public SoyBase database (httpr/soybase.org).
During the quality control process, SNPs without a physical position on 20 chromosomes,
I
with a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5% and a missing rate > 10% were eliminated from
further analysis.
2.3. Population Structure and Linkage Disequilibrium Analysis
The STRUCTURE (version 2.3.4) program was used to estimate the population structure
with
I
the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo model (MCMC) (Hubisz et al. 2009). The
burn-in length of the 10,000 MCMC iterations and the subsequent 50,000 iterations were
used to estimate the parameters. Three replicates were performed for each K value (K=2-
8). The true K value was determined by a web tool called STRUCTURE HARVESTER, as
described by Earl and Vonholdt (2012). A kinship matrix was calculated using TASSEL
version 5.0 (Bradbury et al. 2007) to determine relatedness among individuals. Pairwise LD
between SNP markers was calculated with squared allele frequency correlations (2) in
TASSEL version 5.0 (Bradbury et al. 2007).
I
2.4. Genome-Wide Association Analysis
Genome-wide association analysis was performed with a mixed linear model (MLM) in R
package GAPIT (Lipka et al. 2012). The average value of SCN Female Index (FI) value per
I
accession was used as phenotype for GWAS analysis as previously described (Arelli et al.
2000; Vuong et al. 2015). The Q matrix generated from STRUCTURE and a kinship matrix
were used to account for population structure and kinship, respectively. We also ran the
GWAS without using the Q matrix to control population structure, and both models (with
and without the Q matrix) generated similar results. We then used permutation as previously
described (Zhang et al. 2015a; Zhang et al. 2015b) to determine the significance threshold
with the empirical significance value (p <0.001).

2.5. Candidate Gene Prediction
Genes located within 50 kb on both sides of the significant SNPS were selected as the source
for candidate gene identification as previously described (Zhang et al. 2016b). Annotations

conducted using Blast2GO software (Conesa et al. 2005) or through reference annotation of
the Williams 82 soybean reference genome G. max Wm82.a2.1 (SoyBase, http:/1
soybase.org), as well as previously published literatures. Genes localized with significant
SNPS or with functional descriptions relevant to disease resistance were regarded as
candidate genes involved in the G. soja response to SCN race 1.
3. Results
3.1. Variation in G. soja Response to Race 1 Infection
The set of 1,032 G. soja accessions used in this study represents 88.3% of the USDA wild
soybean germplasm collection (1,168 accessions) (ntp/www.arx-gningow), The phenotype
data showed a wide range of variation in the G. soja response to race 1 infection in this
studied population. The FI values of 1,032 G. soja accessions ranged from 30 to 168.3, with
an average FI value of 76.8 (Figure 2A).
3.2. SNP data and LD in G.
population
€
soja
A SoySNP50K Illumina Infinium II BeadChip containing 52,041 SNPS was used to
genotype the G. soja population. As a result, a total of 41,087 SNPS were polymorphic
among the 1,032 G. soja accessions. After quality control, 31,019 SNPS with a minor allele
frequency 5% and a miss rate > 10% were saved for further analyses. The SNP markers
I
ranged from 1,643 on chromosome 20 to 3,221 on chromosome 18, with an average of 1,550
for each soybean chromosome. Accordingly, the SNP density across chromosomes ranged
from 17.2 kb on chromosome 13 to 33.08 kb on chromosome 1, with an average genome-
wide SNP density of one SNP per 23 kb. The trend of LD decay by plotting 2 against
distances (kb) between SNP pairs showed that the LD decays quite rapidly (Figure 2B). The
LD decay rate (the distance where the maximum r2 drop to half of its value) was estimated
€
as 10 kb.
3.3. Population structure
To understand the genetic relationships among the 1,035 G. soja accessions, a model-based
Bayesian clustering method was used to characterize the population structure. The results
from STRUCTURE HARVESTER
and Vonholdt
I
(Earl
2012) indicated that the highest K
value was observed at K= 4 (Figure S1B), suggesting that this population contains four
subgroups (Figure S1A). To further understand population stratification in this G. soja
population, an NJ tree for the 1,032 accessions was constructed. As shown in Figure 2C, the
resulting NJ tree clustered the 1,032 accessions into four groups, with accessions from Japan
and South Korea each forming a group, accessions from northern China and Russia sharing
one larger group, and accessions from southern China clustering in a smaller group. These
I
results indicate a high correlation between geographical origin and population structure in
the G. soja population, which is also observed in the G. max population (Zhang et al.
2015a). The consistency of the structure in the two analyses was also manually checked, and
the four clusters identified by the NJ tree are consistent with the population stratification
observed with STRUCTURE. For example, as observed in NJ tree, accessions from South
Korea (red) and Japan (blue) were also primarily assigned into two major

were separately grouped (Figure S1A). Thus, it is appropriate to classify this set of sample
into four groups, which can appropriately account for the population structure.
3.4. Association Mapping
Association analysis were performed using the MLM model in GAPIT with the population
structure controlledby the Q matrix (K = 4) from STRUCTURE and familial relatedness.
After 1,000 permutations, the SNP markers were identified as significantly associated with
the
to SCN race
I
response
1 infection using a threshold of -Log (P-value) 3.64. As aresult,
a total of ten SNPS significantly associated with the G. soja response to race 1 infection were
identified. These significant SNPs are located on five chromosomes (2, 4, 9, 16, and 18)
(Figure 3, Table 1). Of the ten significant SNPS, four are clustered on chromosome 4 and
two are grouped on chromosome 18. Many of the significant SNPS are located within the
previously identified QTLS. For example, the significant SNPS, ss715628474 and
ss715628480, on chromosome 4 are localized within two previously mapped QTLS, SCN
E
18-5and SCN 19-4(Yue et al. 2001); ss71561958on chromosome 18 is located within a
known QTL SCN 37-2(Vuong et al. 2010). The other seven significant SNPs without CO-
localization in known QTLs related to SCN resistance are regarded as novel. The ten SNPs
explained 11.42-11.84% of the total phenotypic variation.
3.5. Candidate Genes Associated with the G. soja Response to SCN Race 1 Infection
I
To further understand the molecular mechanism of the G. soja response to race 1 infection,
genes located in or close to significant SNPS were evaluated. Four soybean genes were
located within the SNP regions (Table 1) and were thus considered the most likely candidate
genes underlying the G. soja response to SCN race 1. Another six SNPs were located in
intergenic regions. In addition, genes within 50 kb at either side of significant SNPS were
also retrieved, as previously described (Zhang et al. 2016b). As a result, a total of 83 gene
E
models were predicted within the search region (Table S2), thirteen of which might be
involved in plant disease resistance based on reference annotations and results from
published literature (Table 1). This candidate list includes genes encoding calcium-
dependent phospholipid-binding protein, leucine-rich repeat protein kinase family protein,
nucleotide-binding (NB)-ARC domains-containing protein, ethylene-responsive element
I
binding factor, and cytochrome P450 family protein.
It is important to note that the gene Glyma./8G102600on chromosome 18 was regarded as a
highly promising candidate gene involved in G. soja responding to SCN race 1 infection
because this gene is located in a strong LD block (average 2 = 0.88) harboring two
significant SNPS, Ss715628474: and ss71568480 (Figure 4). Glyma. 18G102600encodes an
NB-ARC domains-containing protein, a typical disease resistance protein involved in
€
pathogen recognition and activation of the innate immune
-
response (Van Ooijen et al. 2008).

resistance after many years; pests, especially pathogens and viruses, can evolve rapidly
because of their short life cycles and the selection pressure from host plants. To date, most
E
pest-resistant cultivars have been developed using the gene pool of cultivated crops. It is
known that the genetic diversity in modern cultivated crops has been substantially reduced
during domestication (Hyten et al. 2006), whereas their wild relatives retain much higher
genetic diversity. The promising potential of wild relatives in crop improvement has been
gradually recognized in recent decades, and their application for crop improvement is well
documented
et al. 2016a). In G. the identification of
characteristics in
I
(Zhang
soja,
superior
abiotic stress tolerance (Qi et al. 2014) and biotic stress resistance (Tian and Smith 2015)
suggests that G. soja harbor promising novel genetic resources in biotic and abiotic
resistance/tolerance. As expected, over a dozen of G. soja accessions were identified
resistant to HG type 2.5.7 (race 5) in recent studies (Kim et al. 2011; Kim and Diers 2013;
Zhang et al. 2016b). However, no G. soja resistance showed high levels of resistance to race
1 (FK<10). This lack of resistance might be due to the completely distinct molecular
E
mechanisms of G. soja defending against race 5 (HG type 2.5.7) VS. race 1. Our recent study
(Zhang et al. (2016b) identified different SNPs and candidate genes involved in G. soja
resistant to race 5 (type 2.5.7) compared to this current study on SCN race 1.
The continuous distribution of FI values suggests that the G. soja response to SCN race 1 is
quantitatively controlled, which can involve many genes and the interactions between them.
I
Although no G. soja accessions showed FI value < 10, which is not quite useful for breeding
scientists, it is such a large population with wide variation in resistance levels. Thus,
together with large genomic data available, this is useful population to understand the
genetic basis of resistance variation in G. soja, which is our main aim in this study. To date,
the majority of QTLs underlying SCN resistance have been identified from linkage mapping
cultivated soybeans (Concibido et al. 2004; Guo et al. 2006; Wu et al. 2009; Vuong et al.
2010; Han et al. 2015; Vuong et al. 2015), which can only capture the variation of the two
parental individuals. It is not surprising that some of the
SNPS identified our
I
significant
in
study are not located within the previously identified QTLs underlying SCN resistance as
this studied populations capture diversity from over a thousand of accessions, rather than
two parents. Indeed, we expect to identify novel SNPs or candidate genes in G. soja as it is a
genetically different species from cultivated soybean (G. max), and the former also harbors
I
much higher genomic diversity than the latter. Identification of the genomic regions
responsible for the race 1 response in our study might provide a novel understanding ofthe
genetic architecture of the G. soja response to SCN. Nevertheless, our study provides several
genomic regions that might be response to the large variation of G. soja resistance to SCN
race 1, and the two loci on chromosome 18 are promising candidate markers deserving
further investigation.
4.2. Candidate Genes Involved in G. soja Response to SCN Race 1
I
The current knowledge of SCN resistance genes stem from the identification of two key loci,
rhgl (Cook et al. 2014) and Rhg4 (Liu et al. 2012). These studies indicated that a copy
number of three tandem genes (an amino acid transporter, an alpha-SNAP, and a WI12
protein) (rhgl) and a serine hydroxymethyltransferase function (Rhg4) in SCN resistance.
I
These findings were not consistent with the results that plant resistance to pathogens or pests

is controlled by canonical NB-ARCor NBS-LRR-type genes (Cheng and Li 2012). The
rhgl and Rhg4 genes were not identified among the 83 gene models within the search
E
regions of the significant SNPS in this study. Explanations include: 1) the genetic
architecture of most quantitative traits is very complex and population-specific, with
different QTLs/candidate genes for the same trait identified in different populations and/or
species. The wild soybean used here is the closest wild relative of cultivated soybean, but
has a substantially higher level of genetic diversity. We therefore did not expect to find the
same SNPs/genes controlling the SCN
to racel in our
as those
I
response

previously
discovered in the cultivated soybean populations. 2) This result may simply be a reflection
of a lack of sufficiently close SNP markers. The linkage disequilibrium blocks in wild
soybean populations are much smaller than those in domesticated soybean samples. 3) The
frequency of the responsible alleles might be very low, and GWAS fails to detect them (Auer
and Lettre, 2015).
Previous studies have indicated that protein kinases show a broad spectrum of resistance to
diverse invading
et al. 1995; Gomez-Gomez Boller
E
pathogens (Song
and
2000). Mutation of
a receptor-like protein kinase, RPK2, results in a decrease in both nematode infection and
syncytium size in the rpk2mutant (Replogle et al. 2013), which suggests the important roles
ofkinase in nematode resistance. However, plants trigger a cascade of defense signals once
they encounter environmental stress. The calcium-mediated regulation of plant immunity
I
(Lecourieux et al. 2006) and plant phytohormones, such as ethylene (Lorenzo et al. 2003),
are two important regulatory mechanisms involved in plant defense signaling that
subsequently trigger a battery of defense actions. In our recent studies using transcriptome
profiling to characterize the molecular mechanism of the soybean-SCN interaction,
significant changes in the expression of genes participating in calcium and ethylene-related
pathways were observed, suggesting that calcium and ethylene play important roles in
soybean defense against or response to SCN infection (Klink et al. 2007b; Klink et al.
2007a; Kandoth et al. 2011). Calcium- and
defense
was
E
ethylene-mediated plant
signaling
recently verified conserved in the plant defenses against nematodes, as previously described
(Manosalva et al. 2015).
Plant R proteins have been extensively studied in plant defenses against diverse pathogens
I
and pests (Van Ooijen et al. 2008; Cheng and Li 2012). However, to date, the major SCN-
resistant genes are not canonical NBS-LRR or NB-ARC genes; several types of R genes
were identified as resistant to other nematodes in various plants (Williamson and Kumar
2006). In addition, a significant change in R gene expression in soybean roots was observed
after SCN infection (Klink et al. 2007b; Guo et al. 2015). Thus, the putative disease-resistant
R gene (Glyma./8G102600) that was identified in a strong LD block harboring two
significant SNPs might be a promising candidate gene meriting further investigation.
