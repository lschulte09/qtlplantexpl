Abstract
Background: The hundred seed weight (HSW) is one of the yield components of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill]
and is especially critical for various soybean food types. In this study, a representative sample consisting of 185
accessions was selected from Northeast China and analysed in three tested environments to determine the
quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN) of HSW through a genome-wide association study (GWAS).
Result: A total of 24,180 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS) with minor allele frequencies greater than 0.2 and
missing data less than 3% were utilized to estimate linkage disequilibrium (LD) levels in the tested association
panel Thirty-four association signals were identified as associated with HSW via GWAS. Among them, nineteen
QTNS were novel, and another fifteen QTNS were overlapped or located near the genomic regions of known HSW
QTL. A total of 237 genes, derived from 31 QTNS and located near peak SNPS from the three tested environments
in 2015 and 2016, were considered candidate genes, were related to plant growth regulation, hormone
metabolism, cell, RNA, protein metabolism, development, starch accumulation, secondary metabolism, signalling,
and the TCA cycle, some of which have been found to participate in the regulation of HSW. A total of 106 SNPS
from 16 candidate genes were significantly associated with HSW in soybean.
Conclusions: The identified loci with beneficial alleles and candidate genes might be valuable for the molecular
network and MAS of HSW.
