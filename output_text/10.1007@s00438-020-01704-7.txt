Abstract
As a globally important legume crop, soybean provides excellent sources of protein and oil for human and livestock nutrition.
Improving seed protein and oilcontents has always been an important objective in soybean breeding. Water-soluble protein
plays a significant role in the processing and efficacy of soybean protein. Here, a genome-wide association study (GWAS)
of seed compositions (protein, oil, and water-soluble protein contents) was conducted using 211 diverse soybean accessions
genotyped with a 355 K SoySNP array. Three, four, and five QTLs were identifiedrelated to the protein, oil, and water-soluble
protein contents, respectively. Furthermore, five QTLs (qPC-15-1, qOC-8-1, 90C-12-1.90C-20-1 and qWSPC-8-1) were
detected in multiple environments. Analysis of the favorable alleles for oil and water-soluble protein contents showed that
q0C-8-1 (qWSPC-8-1) exerted inverse effects on oil and water-soluble protein synthesis. Relative expression analysis sug-
gested that Glyma. 15G049200 in qPC-15-1 affects protein synthesis and Glyma.08G107800 in qOC-8-1 and qWSPC-8-1
might be involved in oil and water-soluble protein synthesis, producing opposite effects. The candidate genes and significant
SNPS detected in the present study will allow a deeper understanding of the genetic basis for the regulation of protein, oil
and water-soluble protein contents and provide important information that could be utilized in marker-assisted selection for
soybean quality improvement.
