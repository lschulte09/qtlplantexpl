Abstract
Background: Soybean oil is a complex mixture of five fatty acids (palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic).
Soybean oil with a high oleic acid content is desirable because this monounsaturated fatty acid improves the
oxidative stability of the oil. To investigate the genetic architecture of oleic acid in soybean seeds, 260 soybean
germplasms from Northeast China were collected as natural populations. A genome-wide association study (GWAS)
was conducted on a panel of 260 germplasm resources.
Results: Phenotypic identification results showed that the oleic acid content varied from 8.2 to 35.0%. A total of 2,
311,337 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were obtained. GWAS analysis showed that there were
many genes related to oleic acid content with a contribution rate of 7%. The candidate genes Gyma.11G229600.1
on chromosome 11 and Glyma.04G102900.1 on chromosome 4 were detected in a 2-year-long GWAS. The
candidate gene Glyma.11G229600.1 showed a positive correlation with the oleic acid content, and the correlation
coefficient was 0.980, while Glyma.04G102900.1 showed a negative correlation, with a coefficient of - 0.964.
Conclusions: Glyma.04G102900.1 on chromosome 4 and Glyma.11G229600.1 on chromosome 11 were detected in
both analyses (2018 and 2019). Gyma.04G102900.1 and Glyma.11G229600.1 are new key candidate genes related to
oleic acid in soybean seeds. These results will be useful for high-oleic soybean breeding.
