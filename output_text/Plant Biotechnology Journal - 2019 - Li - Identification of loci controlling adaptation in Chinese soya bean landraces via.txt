and 97 accessions of the wild progenitor of cultivated soya bean, Glycine soja was genotyped
using tGBSO. Based on 99 085 high-quality SNPS, landraces were classified into three sub-
populations which exhibit geographical genetic differentiation. Clustering was inferred from
STRUCTURE, principal component analyses and neighbour-joining tree analyses. Using pheno-
typic data collected at two locations separated by 10 degrees oflatitude, 17 trait-associated SNPS
(TASS) for flowering time were identified, including a stable locus Chr12:5914898 and previously
undetected candidate QTL/genes for flowering time in the vicinity of the previously cloned
flowering genes, E1 and E2. Using passport data associated with the collection sites of the
landraces, 27 SNPS associated with adaptation to three bioclimatic variables (temperature,
daylength, and precipitation) were identified. A series of candidate flowering genes were
detectedwithin linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks surrounding 12 bioclimatic TASS. Nine of these
