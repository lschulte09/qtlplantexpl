Abstract
Background: As a photoperiod-sensitive and self-pollinated species, the growth periods traits play important roles
in the adaptability and yield of soybean. To examine the genetic architecture of soybean growth periods, we
performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a panel of 278 soybean accessions and 34,710 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS) with minor allele frequencies (MAF) higher than 0.04 detected by the specific-
locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) with a 6.14-fold average sequencing depth. GWAS was conducted
by a compressed mixed linear model (CMLM) involving in both relative kinship and population structure.
Results: GWAS revealed that 37 significant SNP peaks associated with soybean flowering time or other growth periods
related traits including full bloom, beginning pod, full pod, beginning seed, and full seed in two or more environments at
-logio(P) > 3.75 or -logio(P) > 4.44 were distributed on 14 chromosomes, including chromosome 1, 2, 3,5,6,9, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 17, 18, 19. Fourteen SNPS were novel loci and 23 SNPS were located within known QTLS or 75 kb near the known
SNPS. Five candidate genes (Glyma.05G101800, Glyma.11G140100, Glyma.11G142900, Gyma.19G099700, Gyma.19G100900)
in a 90 kb genomic region of each side of four significant SNPS (Gm5_27111367, Gm11_10629613, Gm11_10950924,
Gm19_34768458) based on the average LD decay were homologs of Arabidopsis flowering time genes of AT5G48385.1,
AB3G465101,A15G597803 AT1G28050.1, and AT3G26790.1. These genes encoding FRI (FRIGIDA), PUB13 (plant U-box 13),
MYB59, CONSTANS, and FUS3 proteins respectively might play important roles in controlling soybean growth periods.
Conclusions: This study identified putative SNP markers associated with soybean growth period traits, which could be
used for the marker-assisted selection of soybean growth period traits. Furthermore, the possible candidate genes
involved in the control of soybean flowering time were predicted.
