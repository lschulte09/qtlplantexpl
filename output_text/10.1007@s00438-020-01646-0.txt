Abstract
Drought stress, which is increasing with climate change, is a serious threat to agricultural sustainability worldwide. Seed
germination is an essential growth phase that ensures the successful establishment and productivity of soybean, which can
lose substantial productivity in soils with water deficits. However, only limited genetic information is available about how
germinating soybean seeds may exert drought tolerance. In this study, we examined the germinating seed drought-tolerance
phenotypes and genotypes of a panel of 259 released Chinese soybean cultivars panel. Based on 4616 Single-Nucleotide
Polymorphisms (SNPS), we conducted a mixed-linear model GWAS that identified la total of 15 SNPs associated with at least
one drought-tolerance index. Notably, three of these SNPS were commonly associated with two drought-tolerance indices.
Two ofthese SNPS are positioned upstream of genes, and 11 of them are located in or near regions where QTLS have been
previously mapped by linkage analysis, five of which are drought-related. The SNPS detected in this study can both drive
hypothesis-drivenrescarch to deepen our understanding ofgenetic basis of soybean drought tolerance at the germination stage
and provide useful genetic resources that can facilitate the selection of drought stress traits via genomic-assisted selection.
