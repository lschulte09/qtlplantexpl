Soil salinityis a limitingfactor ofcrop yield.The soybean is sensitive to soil salinity, and a dominant
gene, Glyma03932900 is primarlyresponsiblefor salt-tolerance.Theidentification ofhigh throughput
and robustmarkers as well as the deployment of salt-tolerantcultivars are effective approaches to
minimize yieldloss under saline conditions.We utilized high quality (15x) whole-genome resequencing
(WGRS) on 106 diverse soybean lines andidentified three major structural variants and allelic
variation in the promoterand genicregions ofthe GmCHX1 gene.The discovery of fsingle nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPS) associatedwith strutuaivariantsfadlitated the design ofsix KASPar assays.
Additionally, haplotype analysis and pedigree tracking gof93U.S. ancestrallines were performed using
publically available WGRS datasets. Identified ISNP markers were validated, and a strong correlation
was observed between the genotype and salttreatment phenotype (leaf scorch, chlorophyll content
and Na+ accumulation) using a panel of 104 soybeanlines and, an interspecific bi-parental population
(Fg)from P1483463 x Hutcheson.These markers precisely identifiedsalt-tolerant/sensitive genotypes
(>91%), and diferentstructuralwariants (>98%). These SNP assays, supported by accurate
phenotyping, haplotype analyses and pedigree tracking information, will accelerate marker-assisted
selection programs to enhance the development of fsalt-tolerant soybean cultivars.
The development of fsustainable high-yield varieties that persist under biotic and abiotic stresses is a prerequisite
for meeting global food demand'. Approximately 20% ofthe world's total land area is affected by salt, and this
area is increasing as a result ofirrigation, water quality andland clearing23. Salinity not only affects plant health
but talso influences soilfunction, the soil microbiome, pest/disease infestation and other factors that finally affect
overall crop yield.
Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is considered as a semi-salt sensitive crop*, with salinity causing a 20-40%
reduction in seed lyieldss. Salinity occurs when the levelofsoluble salt - most often sodium chloride (NaCI), is
elevated lin soil and water. Salt-tolerant plants differ from salt-sensitive ones in theirlow rate ofNat and Cl trans-
portto leaves; their ability to compartmentalize salt tions in vacuoles to prevent their build-up in cytoplasm or cell
wall, thereby avoiding salt toxicity; and the presence ofa salt exclusion mechanism in which Nat and Cl ions are
notstored lin roots, ensuring that tions do not accumulate in leaves to patoxic concentration-".Soybeans accumu-
late a higherlevel of Na+ than Cl- in leaves, but the plants more effectively manage to exclude Nat from leaves
than Cl comparedwith other plants'1-13. In addition, injury in soybean leavesis morestrongly linked(2-3 folds)
with Na+ than with CI- concentrations. Plants sense salt stress via both ionic (Na+) and osmotic stress signals,
then activate signaltransduction*, Salt-specific symptoms occur mainly in older leaves, where salt transported
via the transpiration stream accumulates to higher levels over timel2. Older leaves no longer expandand therefore
newly arriving and previously accumulated salt does not get dilutedcompared with younger leaves, causing severe
leaf chlorosis (ie. reduced chlorophyll.content), and necrosis (i.e. leafscorchingl.leading to plant death12.1516 The

been proposed that salts outside ofroots had an immediate effect on cell growth and associated metabolism and
that salt then slowly accumulates inside plantsbefore affecting overall plant function12.
Soybeans in the USDA germplasm collection range widely in their reaction to saltss. In several early studies,
quantitative trait loci (QTL) for soybean salinity tolerance were widely detected and consistently mapped on
chromosome (Chr.) 3 (LGN)15.20-24 Recently, Qi et al.25 utilized de novo assembly and re-sequencing ofa recom-
binant inbred line (RIL) population to identify the salt tolerance gene CHX1 Gpwlipossewdpmalg.se
in a wild soybean [Glycine soja (Siebold & Zucc.)] accession. The identified QTL region overlappedwith the pre-
viously identified Ncl (Chr. 3) locus from cultivar S-10015. Hereafter, in this study we refer to Glyma03g32900 as
GmCHX1. In another study, using map based cloning and expression profiling, Guan et al.24 identified the same
gene named GmSALT3 (Glyma03g32900) in the commercial cultivatedsoybean (G. max) Tiefeng 8. Compared
with salt-sensitive Williams 82 (W82, the reference soybean genome), GmCHX1 contains a r3.8Kb Tyl/copia
retrotransposon insertion in exon 3, resulting in a inon-functionaltruncated transcript25. Another variant without
the retrotransposon produces a full transcriptand lexhibitsa tolerant phenotype. Other than Tyl/copia retrotrans-
poson insertion, sequence variation in the promoter and gene regions of GmCHX1 also results in salt-sensitive
and -tolerant genotypes?5.
Molecular markers are powerful genomic tools for increasing the efficiency and precision of breeding
practices for crop improvement-6- A number of molecular markers such as simple sequence repeats (SSRS),
randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and diversity array technology (DArT) have been used in
molecular plant breeding over the last several decades; however, these marker technologies are labor-intensive
and time-consuming compared with SNP markers29. Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the
availability of sequence information have paved the way for the identification and development of SNP mark-
ers for several crop species. SNP markers have gained significant importance in plant genetics and molecular
breeding due to their suitability for genetic diversity analysis, abundance in genomes, evolutionary relationships
and association with complex phenotypic traits29. Additionally, their detection and related assays are amenable
to automation and thus are useful for high throughput genotyping. The Kompetitive allele-specific polymerase
chain reaction (KASPar) assay has emerged as a cost-effective marker assay, especially for molecular breeding
applications0.31 and has been applied in several plant systems32-35 including soybean6.37. The KASPar assay is
specific to a targeted ISNP or Indel and consists oftwo competitive, allele-specific forward primers (labelled with
fluorescent dye) and one common primer Chtp/hwelgoup.com) The identification of molecular mark-
ers associated with salinity would be helpful for developing tolerant varieties, especially because phenotyping
soybeans according to salinity response is time-consuming, labor-intensive and costly. Additionally, evaluation
of salinity-tolerance via conventional breeding programs is difficult because the salt concentration graded in a
horizontal or rvertical direction in the field*. In this study, we evaluated la salt-tolerance locus to verify the allelic
variation in 106 soybean resequencing lines and identified SNPS in the promoter as well as exonic and intronic
regions for the development tofaj panel ofbreeder-friendly KASPar assays.
Results
Greenhouse screening for salinity tolerance. To determine salt stress response, 104 out of fa total of
106 soybean genotypes with available whole genome sequence data were screened by the Plastic Cone-tainer
(PC) method under greenhouse conditions38. Salt screening in a greenhouse can be easily controlled land moni-
tored39. Thereaction ofthe esalt-tolerant(Fiskeby III, HN105) and sensitive (Hutcheson, HN101) genotypes to salt
treatment (120mMNaCI) clearly differed (Fig. 1). The tolerant control scored 1.2 and 0.99, respectively, for the
leaf scorch score (LSS) andleaf chlorophyll content (SPAD ratio after and before treatment), while the sensitive
control scored 4.8 and 0.52, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). In addition, the tolerant control showed no
apparent chlorosis in its leaves, while the sensitive control showedsevere chlorosis. Based on avisual rating ofthe
104 lines evaluated, PI 561271 (HN074) was the most tolerant genotype and PI 548657 (HN071) was the most
sensitive genotype (Fig. 1A). A correlation between LSS and SPAD ratio was calculated by regression analysis
to determine confidence level. The results indicatedahigh correlation (r2= 0.76) between the two assessment
methods (Fig. 1B).
The combination ofphenotypic data (SPAD ratio and LSS) was utilized to determine the cluster between
salt-sensitive and -tolerant genotypes by Euclidean distance using NTSYS-pc software40 (Fig. 1C). The 104 lines
were clustered into two major groups; tolerant (35 lines) and sensitive (69 lines). Based on our results, approxi-
mately 32% oftested genotypes via re-sequencing were salt-tolerant. A majority ofthe lines were U.S. cultivars
thathave been utilized lin many soybean breeding programs. The tolerant and sensitive groups were further subdi-
videdinto two sub-clusters, I-II andIII-IV, respectively. Comparing the mean values of thetwo clusters (p < 0.01,
Duncan's multiple range test, Table 1) revealeda significant difference. Cluster I showed superior salinity toler-
ance and had an average LSS of 1.0, whereas cluster IV exhibited higher salt sensitivity and had an average LSS
of 4.70. Clusters II and III showed moderate tolerance (LSS == 2.30) and/or moderate sensitivity (LSS == 3.60) in
response to salt stress, respectively. Leafchlorophyll lcontent (SPAD ratio) was significantly decreasedfrom cluster
Ito cluster IV. The tolerant tand sensitive controls were groupedinto their respective tolerant and sensitive groups
(Fig. 1C). To investigate the accumulation ofNa+ in leaf tissue, five representative genotypes (3 tolerant and 12
sensitive) were evaluated at OmM and 120mM NaCl concentrations. At 120mM NaCI, the Na+ concentrations
in leaftissue were significantly lower in tolerant genotypes than sensitive genotypes, suggesting a mechanism of
limiting Na+ transport in leaftissue (Supplementary Fig. S1). To elucidate the relationship between salt tolerance
and allelic variation, whole genome re-sequencing data were used to identify SNP markers as discussed below.
Genome-wide association study. To identify and obtain insight into genes controlling salt tolerance
in soybean, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed on the106 soybean lines using an expe-
dited single-locus mixed model (EMMAX) implemented in the SVS suite (v8.1.5). The efficient EMMAX model

ble SoySNP50K42 (-42,509) SNP data were utilized for the analysis and comparison between ofthe datasets. After
initial quality filtering, over 51 million SNPS from WGRS data and over 37,400 SNPS generated by SoySNP50K42
were considered for association mapping. Using WGRS and SoySNP50K, both datasets pin-pointed a single and
highly significant tassociation for average SPAD ratio and ILSS (Supplementary Table SIA, B) on Chr. 3 (40520215-
40637459) (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 2). This region overlapped with a previously identified salt-tolerant locus,
and the gene Glyma03g32900 (GmCHX1), characterized for salt tolerance in soybean, was detected(Fig. 2C).
GWAS identified 19 and 11 SNPS using SoySNP50K data, and 401 and328 SNPS were identified lusing WGRS data
that were associated with LSS and SPAD, respectively, at the significancelevel -logioP N 7.3. The most significant
SNP (-logiop22.62) ofWGRS data for LSS was identified within the GmCHX1 gene (fourth intron) and explained
63% ofthe phenotypic variation (Supplementary Table S1B). Genome-wide analysis showedthatnatural variation
associated with this gene has a major impact on salt tolerance in soybean. Therefore, subsequent analysis was
focused on the GmCHX1 gene.

genome re- sequencing (WGRS) data. The wealth of whole genome resources for soybean provides a unique
method to study natural variation in germplasm and further allows the functional characterization of candi-
date genes242543 Complete genome sequences for the 106 soybean genotypes, sequenced at approximately 15X
coverage, were utilized for analysis. To observe phylogenetic clustering, multi-sampled SNPS for the GmCHX1
locus, including a 2Kb promoter region (Chr. 3: 40621077-40634451) were extracted from the WGRS data and
were utilizedto infer phylogenetic relationships. In addition to the 106 lines, we included 23 previously reported
salt-tolerant and -sensitive genotypes from 31 soybean re-sequencing lines4. These 23 lines were sequenced at
relativelylower coverage compared with the other 106lines and groupedclosely together in the phylogenetictree
(Fig. 3). Phylogenetic analysis of129 lines showedthree distinct clusters associated with structural land allelicvar-
iation atthe GmCHX1 locus (Fig. 3). Based on the salt-treatment phenotypic data (LSSandSPAD ratio), tolerant
indicator lines such as S-100 (HNO28) and Fiskeby III (HN105) as well as a wild soybean genotype, PI483463
(HN063) were clustered separately. On the other hand all ofthe sensitive genotypes were clustered into two
distinct subgroups with the known salt-sensitive indicator lines Hutcheson (HN001), W82 (Ref) and Maverick
(HN030). In agreement with previous studies?5, the 23 genotypes from 31 re-sequencedlines were also grouped
into their respective salt-tolerant or -sensitive clusters. In addition, we utilized the genome sequence information
of93 U.S. ancestral lines45 to explore allelic diversity at the GmCHX1 locus. These 93 diverse accessions com-
prise 23 wild soybeans (G. soja), 45 landraces, and 25 improved cultivars and represent primary founder lines of
U.S. soybean breeding programs16. When compared with known salt-tolerant and sensitive-lines from 106 ger-
mplasm accessions, we identified 123 lines which were clustered with salt-tolerant accessions and the remainder
with salt-sensitive genotypes. These lines were assigned to three structural variant (SV) groups (Supplementary
Table S2).
Identification of structural variants associated with salt-tolerant and sensitive
groups. GmCHX1belongs to the sodium/hydrogen (Na+/H+) exchanger family and comprises 10 transmem-
brane domains (TMD) (Supplementary Fig. S5). Recently, an improved assembly of the soybean genome was
released (htpliphytozome.jgidocgov/puiportalhtml, and the gene Glyma03g32900 was predicted to produce
two transcript models (Glyma.03G171600, Glyma.03g171700) in the new soybean genome assembly (Wm82.
a2.v1). However, in the first assembly (W82.al.v1), this gene was predicted to have a single transcript. This pre-
diction oftwo transcripts could be due to considering an alternative spliced model as two separate genes. In this
study, we used assembly one for consensus alignment and further genotypic inference. To infer allelic variation,
the -13Kb consensus sequence ofthe gene GmCHXI,including the gene plus a 2Kb upstream promoter region,
was aligned with the soybean reference genome. Based on 100% similarity, the alignment with the reference
genome revealed three major structural variants (SV) SV-1,SV-2 andSV-3(Fig. 4A) and severalSNPs (Fig. 4B,
Supplementary Table S3). SV-1 was similar to the salt-sensitive W82, C0825, as well as 85-140 genotypes?4 that

retain -3.3Kb Tyl/copia retrotransposon in exon 3. The presence ofthe Tyl/copia retrotransposon results in
loss-of-function, leading to asalt-sensitive genotype. In contrast, SV-2 does not carry the Tyl/copia retrotranspo-
son and hence expresses full-length protein (811 aa residue, NCBI ID KF879911.1), confirming the salt-tolerant
genotype?5. SV-1 and SV-2 have been reported in earlier studies24,25, whereas SV-3 was identified in this study.
Genotypes belongingto SV-3 also lack the Tyl/copia retrotransposon; however, phenotypically, this group oflines
is sensitive to salt treatment. To understand the phenotypic differences between the SV-2 and SV-3lines, we stud-
ied the variation in the promoter and coding regions ofthese two groups. It is known that SNPs in the coding or
promoter regions can abolish proteinlocalization andfunction. Wei identified 29 SNPS in the promoter region and
nine non-synonymous SNPs leading to an amino acid changespecific to the SV-3 group (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Three out of nine nonsynonymous SNPS (at amino acid position 13, 354 and 1450) were identified at a high fre-
quencyi in the SV-3 group compared with the other six SNPS (Supplementary Fig. S3).Furthermore, an r180 bp
deletion (A232-292 aa) in exon 3 and two large deletions in the first andsecond lintrons were identified (Fig. 4A,
indicated by aredline) that were confined to SV-3, with exception ofgenotype HN058 (PI 438258). Based lon a
transmembrane topology prediction tool, GmCHX1 comprises 10 transmembrane domains (TMD),andt the dele-
tion starting at 232 aa resulted in the loss of the seventh transmembrane helix domain (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Qi et al.25 also identified a deletion in exon 3, but this deletion was smaller than those that we observed, possibly
due to the different sets ofsoybean lines usedin each both study. Haplotype analysis using SNP information from
the 129 lines (106 re-sequencedlines and 23 out of31 lines from Lam et al.44 with known salinity reactions) was
performed(Supplememtary Fig. S4).Overall, allelic variation other than the Tyl/copia retrotransposon insertion
could be the reason for salt-sensitive genotypes in SV-1, although further studies are required to confirm this
inference.
Discovery ofinformative SNP markers associated with the salt-tolerance gene. The WGRS and
phenotypic correlation information of104 soybean lines were used Ito identify SNP marker(s) associatedwith the
salt-tolerance locus. First, SNPS associated with three allelic variants (Fig. 4B) were considered, including three
SNPslocated in the promoter region (the 5' UTR (untranslatedregion) and, thirteen in the genic region (introns
and exons). To evaluate which SNP correlated with the three structural variants, six SNPS - M1 (-20bp, pro-
moter), M2 (38bp, first exon), M3 (8961 bp, third intron), M4 (9011bp, thirdintron), M5 (10705bp, fifth exon)
and M6 (6th exon) - were selected for KASPar assay design. Based on genotypic data, M2 and M3 were able to
differentiate between SV-1,SV-2 with SV-3 suggesting that these markers were associated with 'Hutcheson type'
(ie. SV-3, without transposon insertion) salt-sensitive genotypes. The M5 SNP was associated with Tyl/copia
retrotransposon insertion and differentiated betweenSV-lvs. SV-2andSV-3. Importantly, the SNP markers M1,
M4 and M6 were associated with salt-sensitive (SV-1 andSV-3) and salt-tolerant (SV-2) lines.
Validation ofmakers in diverse germplasm and linterspecific population. Three KASPar assays
(M2, M3 and M5) were selected to identify the structural variants representative ofthree groups. The M2 and
M3 marker assays precisely differentiated SV-3 from SV-1 and SV-2 with a >98% success rate (Supplementary
Table S4; Fig. 5B,C). Similarly, the marker M5 differentiated between a transposon insertion allele (SV-1)

and a non-insertion allele (SV-2, -3) with a >98% success rate (Fig. 5E). The SNP genotypes were found to
be in complete agreement with the three structural variant groups (Supplementary Table S3). To evaluate the
genotype-phenotype correlation for salt tolerance in diverse lines, the salt tolerance phenotypic data of 104
lines were tested with three (M1, M4 and M6) KASPar assays (Fig. 5A,D). A strong correlation was observed
between SNP genotype and reaction to salt, with the exception of 10 lines (success rate >91%). However, the
success rates of genotyping for high tolerance (cluster 1) and sensitivity (cluster 4) were 95 and100%, respectively
(Fig. 1C, Supplementary Tables S1 and S4). In agreement with the previous studies44,Peking (HN002) carries
salt-tolerant alleles similar to those of other salt-tolerantlines; however, phenotypically, this line was found to be
salt-sensitive (SPAD ratio 0.67, LSS 3.6). On the basis of fhierarchical clustering, Peking grouped with the S-100
line (SV-2), suggesting thatthis gene mightbe suppressed aftertranscription or that its expression mightberegu-
lated by unknown cis or trans-elements; however, further study is needed to validate these observations.
In addition to 104 diverse sequencing lines, we performed a precise genotyping test on an interspecific
bi-parental population of Fs recombinant inbredlines (RILS) from a PI 483463 x Hutcheson cross48,49 (Fig. 5F;
Supplementary Table S5). The parental line PI 483463 (HN063) is awild soybean accession (G. soja) and carries
a salt tolerance allele (SV-2), while Hutcheson (HN001) carries a salt sensitivity allele (SV-3) (Fig. 3). HN063 (PI
483463) andHNO28IGDE-12916100 are consideredhighly salt-tolerantlines with the common ancestor S-100,
according to the U.S. breeding programs'548 Plant reactions to salt treatment showed that Hutcheson exhibited
severe leaf fscorch; however, the leaves ofPI 483463 were less affectedby salt injury (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table
S1). We also tested M1 and M6 markers on artificialheterozygous DNA, in which the DNA oftolerant (HN105 or
HN063) andsensitive (HN001 or Williams 82) accessions were mixed at equal 10ng concentrations. This artificial
heterozygote allele correctly designated the genotype and was clustered between mutant and wild-type alleles
(Fig. 5A,F). Overall, a strong association was observed between SNP genotype and reaction to salt treatment in
the RIL population at a success rate >94.5%. This shows that the gene-based molecular markers and the geno-
typing assay developed in this study are powerful and efficient tools for selecting true heterozygotes in an early
generation (F,) for genetic studies or breeding purposes, as well as for selecting tolerant genotypes from diverse
soybean germplasm.
Discussion
An important goal of whole genome re-sequencing data analysis of crop species is to explore genetic variation
in diverse germplasm resources, such as wild species, landraces and improved cultivars and to identify molec-
ular markers that accelerate breeding cycles. Soybean germplasm, both G. max and G. soja species, provide a
wide range of salt tolerances. For many years, a great effort has been made to understand the mechanism of
salt reaction39 andto precisely identify gene(s) underlying salt tolerance QTL in soybeans2425. Previous studies
have shown that a QTL on Chr. 3 is the major genomic region determining salinity tolerance in soybean. This

locus carries the dominant functional sodium/hydrogen exchanger family gene Glyma03g32900 (GmCHX1) and
accounts for more than 64% ofthe phenotypic variation?5. GWAS is sa statistically powerful approach and provides
ahigher resolution to identify the position of genetic factors underlying the trait ofinterest1550-52 Alarge number
ofGWAS has been successfully conducted in soybean using SoySNP50K and WGRS data for nematode resist-
ance50 carbon-isotope,oil. land protein content1552, and domestication traits45.In this study, GWAS pin-pointed
a single major and significant locus on Chr. 3 that harbors the previously characterized GmCHX1 gene. While
the SoySNP50K and WGRS data were able to identify the same major loci on Chr 3, the number of SNPS was
relatively higher in WGRS dataset, which was notsurprising. Importantly, high quality WGRS data benefited the
discovery of novel structural lvariants and the large number of fSNPS that were translated linto functional mark-
ers. The results obtained from GWAS thus, allowed us to further investigate the haplotype and SNP variation
using WGRS datasets. The genetic basis of salt tolerance in soybean is relatively less complex compared with the
response to other abiotic stresses (e.g., drought, flooding' 1,53) due to the presence ofa single dominant locus as
detected lin the present study.
In addition to genotypic data, robust salt tolerance assays for generating reliable phenotypic data are also
important for molecular marker development. A conventional method ofscreening for salt tolerance in soybean
was based on visual leaf fscorch score (LSS). However, in the present study, we utilized a combination ofLSS and
leafchlorophyll assessed by a SPAD ratio to determine the phenotypes. The chlorophyll content ofa developing
plant changes significantly under stress conditions, and chlorophylevel hasbeen shown to be a goodindicator of
photosynthetic function 10,12. Chlorophyll fluorescence provides a non-invasive and rapid method for estimating
the photosynthetic) performance of plantss.55.Lenis setals reportedthatincrementalincreases in NaCI concentra-
tion from 25 to 100mM were significantly associated with leafscorch and SAPD ratio. In this study, the significant
negative correlation between LSS and SPADratio gave us additional lconfidence in associating the phenotype with
the genotype.
The function of GmCHX1 was studiedby expressing a tolerant allele using transgenic soybeanhairy roots and
transgenic tobacco BY-2cells?5. This analysis srevealedhealthy hairy roots and dahigher survival rate for BY-2 cells
in the transgenic lines, which confirmed a gain-of-function. The GmCHX1 gene is expressed under elevated salt
conditions in root stellar cells and limits salt transport to shoot tissues24. In other plant species such as cotton*,
rice",Arabidopsi.*s, P tenuifloraso, wheat17,61 and grapevines2, the expression ofNa+ exclusion protein in root
tissue is associatedwith lower Na+ accumulation in shoot tissue. In general, a plant adapts to soilsalinity through
osmotic tolerance, Nat or CI exclusion, and the accumulation ofions in various tissues10.12.63.64. Consistentwith
earlier findingss, significantly lower Nat accumulation in the leaftissues of tolerant genotypes was observed
(Supplementary Fig. S1), confirming sodium exclusion in the above-ground tissues of soybean plants. The toler-
ant genotypes had a lower LSS, greater SPAD ratios and la greater capacity to prevent Na transport from the soil
to stems and leaves than did sensitive lines.
Wild relatives represents a unique resource to study the regulation of salt tolerance and other abiotic stress
responses and present tawiderange ofgenetic diversity for several traits8.16,65,66 The progeny ofa cross between G.
max and G. soja were more tolerantto salt injury than those ofa cross between G. max and G. max48, suggesting
allelic cand backgroundeffects. Previously, Lee et al.48 carried out an allelism test and icondudedithatwild.soybean
has a tolerant locus different from that in the line S-100 (HN028)48.49. However, they subsequently mapped this
trait to a similar genomic region (Chr. 3) and concluded that the tolerance gene from the two sources could be
the same, but the degree oftolerance (after 30 days ofsalt tolerance) was different21. In agreement with previous
studies, we confirmed that wild and cultivated soybean possess the same loci ibut show allelic variation (Fig. 4).
Therefore, differential responses of salt-tolerant genotypes could be (1) the result of allelic variation in promoter
and gene regions?5; (2) due to mechanisms usedto exclude sodium ions from the roots, thereby preventing accu-
mulation at toxic concentrations in the stem and leaves10,12,62, (3) caused by regulation at the transcription or
powt-trankcriptionallevedss, or (4) due to genetic backgroundefct.Qidt al.25 concluded that elimination ofthe
salt tolerance gene in salt-sensitive germplasm could be due to negative selection against a stress tolerance gene
in an unstressed environment because its expression could be an energy burden on the plant when its function
is not required.
Guan et al.24 identified nine haplotypes, including two salt-tolerant haplotypes and seven salt-sensitive hap-
lotypes, based on SNP variation in GmSALT3 (GmCHX1) and its r600 bp promoter region. In this study, we
utilized high-quality, deep sequence information (15X) for GmCHX1 loci (gene plus 2kb up- and down-stream
sequence) and identified three major structural variants and several SNPS (Supplementary Table S3). A number
of SNPS identified in this study matched with previously reported SNPS. However, two insertions of 148bp and
4bp in the promoter region reported by Guan et al.24 were not observed linour sequencedlines, inagreement with
are-sequencing analysis by Qiet tal.25
In previous studies15.22.47 SSR and ISCAR (Sequence Characterized Amplified Region) markers were utilizedin
association with salinity tolerance based on the sequence information obtained by mapping parents to genotype
diverse germplasm. Several ISSR marker alleles were found to be associated with salt tolerance phenotypes in the
descendants and diverse germplasm. A majority of SSRs can amplify multiple alleles at one locus depending on
the genetic background, despite the fact that the same allele may not always be associated with that particular
trait47.67 In addition, popular PCR or non-PCR basedmarkers, including SSR and SCAR makers, have limitations
for use in high-throughput genotyping, such as high costand transferability in complex genomes and diverse ger-
mplasm. In next-generation breeding, these markers cannot be usedin high-throughput genotyping technologies
as required by breeders to accelerate selective breeding for a number oftraits. Correct identification and qual-
ity assurance are crucial to ensure reproducible breeding programs. Thus, next-generation SNPS along with the
KASPar genotyping method loffer rawide range of advantages over other molecular markers68. KASPar assays have
emerged as a powerful tool due to their high-throughput nature,locus specificity, co-dominant inheritance, sim-
ple documentation, transferability between genotyping platforms, lower error rate and lower cost30,36 Moreover,

present investigation using WGRS information.
KASPar assay can be applied to germplasm characterization, allele mining, and fore-ground and back-ground
selection34.
Remarkably, the genotypic andphenotypic data generated in the present study are more resilient tand provided
asolid foundation to develop robust, high-throughput, and breeder-friendly markers. We successfully identified
and validated several SNP-based KASPar assays for salt-tolerance using WGRS information with a >95% pre-
dictionrate (Supplementary TableS1). The KASPar assay was developedtoidentify not only the salt-tolerant and
sensitive genotypes, but also other structural variants at a high frequency (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). All
KASPar assays were tested on artificial heterozygote DNA and showed la perfect cluster with true heterozygotes
(Fig. 5A,F). A few lines (10 out of 106 diverse lines), including the salt-sensitive cultivar Peking (LSS 3.6, SPAD
0.67), did not show an exact correlation between the expected phenotype and the salt tolerance alleles. Several
factors may result in this discrepancy between the genotyping and phenotyping results. One reason could be
that salinity scoring was based on al to 5 scale, making the aforementioned lines with a moderately-tolerant
or moderately-sensitive phenotype difficult to assess. Another possibility is the variation in expression level
ofthe salt-tolerance gene due to unknown (cis or trans) regulation. In rice, a class of endogenous small RNAS
is thought to regulate the expression of salt-responsive genes at the post-transcriptional level69. Recently, He
et al.0 elucidated the role of cyclic electron flow into vacuoles under salt stress in soybean and, suggested Nat
ion compartmentation mechanism. They identified genes associated with Na* that were highly expressed in the
salt-tolerant variety (S111-9) and laccumulated Nat in vacuoles, whereas the salt-sensitive variety (Melrose) accu-
mulated Na+ in the chloroplasts. In agreement with earlier reports1024.70 we conclude that in addition to a major
salt-tolerant gene (GmCHX1), there couldbe minor undetermined element(s) (e.g., post-transcription regulation
or ion compartmentation) involved in salt tolerance in soybean. Future investigation is warrantedto understand
and elucidate these factors.
Lee et al.15 reported that several ancestors ofU.S. soybean cultivars are salt tolerant; however, our analysis
of 93 ancestral lines showed that only 23 lines exhibited a salt-tolerant genotype. The 23 lines included seven
wild accessions, nine landraces and seven improved cultivars, including, Gordon (IGDB-228), Lloyd (IGDB-
259), Sprite (IGDB-257), Zane (IGDB-234), Capital (IGDB-143), Musca (IGDB-231), and Burlison (IGDB-258).
To gain insight into the pedigree information ofthese lines, we used the GRIN @mp/hwwwar-gingwiepg
acclacc.queries.html) and Soybase (htp/wwsoybasc.org) databases. Interestingly, the pedigree of Gordon,
Lloyd, Sprite and Burlison trace back to Lee and S-100 (Fig. 6). The descendants Musca, Zane and Capital can
be traced back to the salt-tolerant line A. K. Harrow (Dr. Thomas Carter personal communication). Similarly,
the salt-sensitive genotypes trace back to Williams82, Tokyo, Davis and Arksoy (Fig. 6, Supplementary Table
S2). This analysis showed that a majority ofthe U.S. soybean cultivars are fixed for the salt-sensitive allele. To
improve salt tolerance, two main approaches can be utilized. The first tapproach includes the exploration ofnatural
genetic variation via direct selection under saline conditions, either in field or under controlled conditions, or
SCENTIFICREPORT5161919 [DOI: 10.1038/srep19199

www.nature.com/scientificreports)
through marker-assisted selection. The second approach includes the generation oftransgenic plants expressing
a salt-tolerance gene371,72. A salt-tolerant transgene (e.g., GmCHX1) can also be utilized for positive selection
with 150-200mM NaCl as the selectable agent7374. Positive selection offers several advantages over herbicide or
antibiotic gene based selection approaches and can be coupled with other transgenes?5. However, this transgenic
approach has several challenges, including acceptance oftransgenic crops and the costs associated with regulation
andlicensing, while screening through marker assisted selection offers several advantages.
In summary, we successfully developed an efficient, high-throughput and cost effective next-generation
KASPar assay for salinity tolerance in soybean using a whole genome resequencing information of 106 diverse
germplasm lines. The newly developed markers and genotype information will greatly benefit soybean breeders
in the development ofsalt-tolerant varieties. In addition, it willhelp to select parent lines to designfuture crosses,
trait introgression and the evaluation of diverse germplasm.
Methods
Plant materials. A subset of104 soybean lines were evaluated for salt tolerance in two independent tests in
the salinity phenotyping facility at University ofMissouri, Columbia, MO,following a wellestabishedprcedure
as previously described38. Briefly, at the V2 growth stage, soybean seedlings in cone-trainers were exposed to salt
water (120mM) addedto a depth ofone-third (7cm) ofthe cone to allow the uptake of fsalt water. Electrical con-
ductivity (EC) was monitored daily. Individual soybean plants were visually rated for salt sensitivity or tolerance
when the sensitive parent, cultivar Hutcheson (HN001), showed severe leaf fscorch (approximately 2 weeks after
treatment with salt water). Leaf scorch was scored using a 1-5 scale, where 1= no apparent chlorosis; 2= slight
(25% ofthe leaves showed chlorosis); 3 == moderate (50% ofthe leaves showed chlorosis and some necrosis);
4= severe chlorosis (75% oftheleaves showed chlorosis and severe necrosis); and 15 == dead (leaves showed severe
necrosis and were withered). The averageleaf scorch score for each genotype was calculated using the equation
(1):
Average leaf scorch score == E(LSSi) (No.of plants)
Total No.of plants
where LSSi i= the level ofleaf scorch score.
The measurements ofleaf chlorophyll content were carried out on the top secondary fully expanded leaves.
At 1 day before and 14d after treatment, the chlorophyll concentration, expressed as SPAD value, was measured
with a chlorophyll meter (Konica Minolta SPAD-502). The SPAD ratio, an indicator ofthe efficiency ofthe pho-
tosynthetic apparatus and shows decreasing chlorophyll content under salt stress, was calculated with a portable
fluorometer (model FMS-2 Hansatech Instruments Ltd., England). After scoring LSS and SPAD,leaves, including
petiole, were harvested separately before and after salt water treatment. The sodium (Na+) content of soybean
leaves for the five genotypes with known levels ofsalt tolerance was measured in two independent experiments
as describedby Lenis et al.s using aPerkin-Elmer (Wellesley, MA, USA) atomic absorption spectrophotometer"*
In addition to the subset of104 germplasm lines, the salt phenotypic data ofan Fs RIL population developed
from an interspecific cross ofPI 483463 and Hutcheson was obtained from a previous studyis. These phenotypic
data were employed to test the association ofthe phenotypes and genotypes that were generated in the present
study.
Genome-wide association study. The WGRS data of 106 lines (-9.4 million SNPS) and SoySNP50K
iSelect BeadChip data42 was utilized for GWAS analysis. The WGRS data (sequencing depth r15X) for 106
lines was obtained from Soybean Genetics and Genomics Laboratory at the University ofMissouri (Valliyodan
et. al. unpublished), and the SoySNP50K data was accessed from the soybean database (htp-l/www.soybase.
org/). After excluding SNPS with more than 10% missing data and la minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 5%,
over 5 million SNPS from WGRS and 37,400 SNPS from SoySNP50K data were usedfor GWAS. The PCA matrix
and identity by descent (IBD) were calculated from LD-pruned SNPS in SVS v8.1.5 (htpl/goldenhelix.com
SNP_ Variation/). A single- -locus mixed linear model developed by the EMMAX method and implementedin SVS
v8.1.5 was used. The EMMAX model corrects for population structure as well as identity by descent (IBD)41.We
used la PCA matrix (first two vectors) andthe IBD matrix to correct for population stratification. We defined the
whole- -genome significance cutoff as empirical"7 threshold 7.3 (p == 5x 10 -8) for selection ofsignificant markers.
Manhattan plots for associated SNPS were visualized in GenomeBrowse v1.0 (Golden Helix, Inc).
Analysis of structural variation. The mapped sequence reads of 106 lines at position (Chr. 3:40621077-
40634451) were used to create a consensus sequence using SAM and BAM tools78. The consensus sequence
was then aligned with the soybean reference genome W82 (Phytozome: Gmax v9.0) using the MEGA 6.079 and
BioEdit80 sequence alignment editor tools. Transcript sequence-based annotation25 was used to identify struc-
tural variants (SV-1, SV-2 and SV-3) associated with the GmCHX1 gene. SNPS were identified using an in-house
SOAP381 pipeline and were confirmed by examining read alignment in the GenomeBrowse tool (http:l/golden-
hdlit.com/Gemomebrowse). SNPS were further analyzed for possible iyotymousnon-syanymous variation
by translation into amino acid sequences.
The publically available WGRS datasets of31 lines44 and 93 US ancestrallines'5 were downloaded to investi-
gate genetic variation. SNP haplotypes were examinedby generating map and genotype data files using TASSEL
5.0 program82 and clustering pictorial output for GmCHX1 genic region was visualized using FLAPJACK and
SNPviz software83,84
SNP and KASPar assay design. Whole -genome re-sequencing coupled with structural variation infor-
mation were used to develop KASPar assays. A panel of six SNPS (Fig. 4B) were selected and targeted for the

development of the KASPar assays. Two allele-specific forward primers with tail sequences and one common
reverse primer were synthesized for the SNP genotyping assays (Supplementary Table S6). The reaction mixture
was prepared according to the protocol describedby KBiosciences (http/www.ksre.ksu.eduligenomics) Briefly,
KASPar assays were run in a 10ulfinal reaction volume containing 5ul KASPar master mix, 0.14pl primer mix,
2ul 10-20ng/ul genomic DNA, and 2.86ul water. The following cycling conditions were used: 15min at 95°C,
followedby 10 touchdown cycles of 20sat94°C,1min at 61 1-55 °C (dropping 0.6°C per cycle); and then 26 cycles
of 20s at 94 °C, 1min at 55°C. The fluorescent end-point genotyping method was carried out using a Roche
LightCycler 480-II instrument (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The seeds of 104 diverse lines
and la RIL population derivedfrom a PI 483463 x Hutcheson cross were germinatedin a greenhouse with 24 seeds
per line. Young leaf ftissuefrom each line was pooled and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. DNA was isolated using
amodified C-TAB extraction protocol.
Statistical analysis. Comparisons between the mean treatment values were made by rleast significance dif
ference (LSD) using Duncan's multiple test.
