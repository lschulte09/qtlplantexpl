Abstract
Background: Soybean seed weight is not only a yield component, but also a critical trait for various soybean food
products such as sprouts, edamame, soy nuts, natto and miso. Linkage analysis and genome-wide association study
(GWAS) are two complementary and powerful tools to connect phenotypic differences to the underlying
contributing loci. Linkage analysis is based on progeny derived from two parents, given sufficient sample size and
biological replication, it usually has high statistical power to map alleles with relatively small effect on phenotype,
however, linkage analysis of the bi-parental population can't detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are fixed in the
two parents. Because of the small seed weight difference between the two parents in most families of previous
studies, these populations are not suitable to detect QTL that have considerable effects on seed weight GWAS is
based on unrelated individuals to detect alleles associated with the trait under investigation. The ability of GWAS
to capture major seed weight QTL depends on the frequency of the accessions with small and large seed weight
in the population being investigated. Our objective was to identify QTL that had a pronounced effect on seed
weight using a selective population of soybean germplasm accessions and the approach of GWAS and fixation
index analysis.
Results: We selected 166 accessions from the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection with either large or small seed
weight and could typically grow in the same location. The accessions were evaluated for seed weight in the field
for two years and genotyped with the SoySNP50K BeadChip containing >42,000 SNPS. Of the 17 SNPS on six
chromosomes that were significantly associated with seed weight in two years based on a GWAS of the selective
population, eight on chromosome 4 or chromosome 17 had significant Fst values between the large and small
seed weight sub-populations. The seed weight difference of the two alleles of these eight significant SNPS varied
from 8.1 g to 11.7 g/100 seeds in two years. We also identified haplotypes in three haplotype blocks with
significant effects on seed weight. These findings were validated in a panel with 3753 accessions from the USDA
Soybean Germplasm Collection.

Conclusion: This study highlighted the usefulness of selective genotyping populations coupled with GWAS and
fixation index analysis for the identification of QTL with substantial effects on seed weight in soybean. This
approach may help geneticists and breeders to more efficiently identify major QTL controlling other traits. The
major regions and haplotypes we have identified that control seed weight differences in soybean will facilitate the
identification of genes regulating this important trait.
