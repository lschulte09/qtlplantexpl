Abstract
Background: The 100-pod fresh weight (PFW), 100-seed fresh weight (SFW), 100-seed dry weight (SDW) and moisture
content of fresh seeds (MCFS) at the R6 stage are crucial factors for vegetable soybean yield. However, the genetic
basis of yield at the R6 stage remains largely ambiguous in soybean.
Results: To better understand the molecular mechanism underlying yield, we investigated four yield-related traits of
133 soybean landraces in two consecutive years and conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using
82,187 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS). The GWAS results revealed a total of 14, 15, 63 and 48 SNPS for PFW,
SFW, SDW and MCFS, respectively. Among these markers, 35 SNPS were repeatedly identified in all evaluated
environments (2015, 2016, and the average across the two years), and most co-localized with yield-related QTLS
identified in previous studies. AX-90496773 and AX-90460290 were large-effect markers for PFW and MCFS,
respectively. The two markers were stably identified in all environments and tagged to linkage disequilibrium (LD)
blocks. Six potential candidate genes were predicted in LD blocks; five of them showed significantly different
expression levels between the extreme materials with large PFW or MCFS variation at the seed development stage.
Therefore, the five genes Glyma.16g018200, Glyma.169018300, Glyma.059243400, Glyma.059244100 and Glyma.059245300
were regarded as candidate genes associated with PFW and MCFS.
Conclusion: These results provide useful information for the development of functional markers and exploration
of candidate genes in vegetable soybean high-yield breeding programs.
