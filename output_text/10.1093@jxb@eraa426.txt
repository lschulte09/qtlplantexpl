Abstract
Soybean seed oil-related traits are related to nutritional effects linked to human
health, as well as to crop domestication. These domesticated traits have significant
differences across various evolutionary types. The integration of evolutionary
population structure (evolutionary types) with genome-wide association studies
increased the power in gene detection and identified one locus for seed oil- and
size-related traits on chromosome 13. This domestication locus, along with another
domestication locus in a 200 kb region, was confirmed by GEMMA and EMMAX.

GmPDAT had higher expressional level in the high-oil and large-seed accessions
than in the low-oil and small-seed accessions. Real-time qPCR analysis of GmPDAT
showed higher expression levels in overexpression lines and lower expression
levels in RNAi lines. Overexpression lines increased seed oil- and size-related traits,
whereas RNAi lines decreased seed oil- and size-related traits. In addition, we
deduced the molecular mechanism of GmPDAT based on the results from linkage
analysis for triacylglycerols and histocytological comparison of transgenic soybean
seeds. This result provides a new approach for identifying domestication genes
with pleiotropic effects.

Introduction
In soybean seed, linolenic acid is a major component of cell membranes; it also plays
a critical role in human health as it cannot be produced within the human body and
is acquired as part of the diet. Traits related to seed oil and seed size are associated
with domestication and are targeted in soybean breeding programs. However,
improving these traits has been a great challenge (Martin et al., 2011). Although
numerous studies of these traits in soybean have been reported, and these traits
have been affected by domestication, knowledge about the genes responsible for
both seed oil- and size-related traits in soybean is limited.
During the past few decades, efforts have been made to dissect the genetic
foundation and molecular mechanism of seed oil-related traits. Approximately five
hundred quantitative trait loci (QTL) (Chung et al., 2003; Han et al., 2012; Sun et al.,
2012; Eskandari et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Cao et al., 2017; Song et al., 2017) or
quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNS) (Niu et al., 2013; Hwang et al., 2014; Contreras-
Soto et al., 2017; Fang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2020) (www.soybase.org) have been
found to be associated with such traits.Genes related to acyl-lipid metabolism in
soybean and Arabidopsis (Li-Beisson et al., 2013) have been reported based on
genome sequencing (Schmutz et al., 2010; Li et al., 2014), comparative genomics
(Zhang et al., 2016), and transcriptome data analyses (Yu et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2016;
Yuan et al., 2017). Some of the genes related to oil biosynthesis have been
confirmed by experimental biology, such as transcription factors GmDof11 (Wang et
al., 2007), GmWRlla (Chen et al., 2018), GmLEC2 (Manan et al., 2017), GmbZIP123
(Song et al., 2013) and GmDREBL (Zhang et al., 2016), and functional genes
GmDGAT1 / GmDAGAT1, GmPLD (lipid hydrolase), GmLPAT (lipid synthenase) (Zhao
et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2016), GmGA200X (Lu et al., 2016), and GmSWEET10a/b
(Wang et al., 2020). Interestingly, the effect of gene AtPDAT on seed oil content was
in conflict in previous studies. While no significant changes of total lipid content or
fatty acid composition of the leaves and seeds are observed in overexpressing
AtPDAT plants or the knockout PDAT1 mutant in Arabidopsis (St√¢hl et al., 2004;
Mhaske et al., 2005), Fan et al. (2013) observed an increase of free fatty acids (FFAS)
4



in Arabidopsis mutant with the knockout PDAT1, which plays a critical role in
mediating triacylglycerols (TAG) synthesis and thereby protecting against FFA-
induced cell death in fast-growing tissues. Pan et al. (2013) found an increase of a-
linolenic acid in TAG in yeast and Arabidopsis overexpressing the PDAT gene. Zhang
et al. (2009) observed a 70 to 80 % decrease of seed oil content in Arabidopsis with
RNAi silencing of PDAT1 in a dgat1-1 background or DGAT1 in a pdat1-1 background.
Marmon et al. (2017) found the compensation of PDAT1 on TAG synthesis in the
absence of DGAT1 in cotyledons with a change in fatty acid composition but without
reducing seed oil content in Camelina sativa. A more direct piecelof evidence in
forward and reverse genetics shows that DGAT1 is a major determinant in oil
accumulation (Xu et al., 2018a). Based on the above inconsistent functions of PDAT1
and DGAT1 in fatty acid biosynthesis in transgenic Arabidopsis (Chen et al., 2016), it
is necessary to investigate the biological function of GmPDAT in soybean oil
biosynthesis.
Soybean seed size is a major trait in breeding, as it is not only a component of seed
yield but also an important morphological trait (Xu et al., 2011). There have been
many reports of the genetic foundation and molecular mechanism of seed size
related traits. Approximately 92 QTN regions (Contreras-Soto et al., 2017; Fang et al.,
2017; Shen et al., 2018) and 388 QTLS for seed size-related traits in soybean have
been documented at Soybase (www.soybase.org). A large number of differentially
expressed genes (DEGS) associated with seed development (Zhang et al., 2009) were
detected by differential expression analysis and comparative genomics analysis.
Evolution and association studies have demonstrated the effect of GmCYP78A10 on
soybean seed size/weight (Wang et al., 2015). Some genes have been cloned and
verified by transgenic experiments, i.e., SBT1.1 in Medicago truncatula and pea
(D'Erfurth et al., 2012); GmMYB73 (Liu et al., 2014) and GmGA200X (Lu et al., 2016)
in Arabidopsis thaliana; GmFAD3 (Singh et al., 2011), GmCYP78A72 (Zhao et al.,
2016), BIG SEEDS1 (Ge et al., 2016), GmWRKY15a (Gu et al., 2017), PP2C-1 (Lu et al.,
2017), GmLEC2 (Manan et al., 2017), GmCYP78A5 (Du et al., 2017), and
GmSWEET10a/b (Wang et al., 2020) in soybean. Jako et al. (2001) showed that seed-
specific over-expression of the DGAT CDNA in wild-type Arabidopsis enhanced oil
5



deposition and increased average seed weight. Zhang et al. (2009) observed the
overlapping functions of PDAT1 and DGAT1 in seed development of Arabidopsis.
Motivated by the above findings, we decided to investigate the genetic effects of
GmPDAT and GmDAGAT1 on seed oil content and sizes in soybean.
Population stratification has long been recognized as a confounding factor in
genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To correct for the effects of population
stratification, several studies have explored the problem of how to control
population structure variation. First, Pritchard et al. (2000) proposed a Bayesian-
model-based method to infer population structure from multilocus genotype data,
and named it STRUCTURE. Falush et al. (2003) modified the STRUCTURE approach
using the linkage model and the F model. Both models can significantly improve the
quality of the population structure inference. However, inferring population
structure in large modern datasets imposes severe computational challenges. Thus,
Raj et al. (2014) developed an approximated STRUCTURE method under a variational
Bayesian framework. In addition, Tang et al. (2005) presented an extension of
maximum likelihood method to estimate individual admixture, namely FRAPPE. The
full maximum likelihood method increases its robustness when compared to an
existing partial maximum likelihood approach. Thereafter, Alexander et al. (2009)
developed a fast model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals, and
named it ADMIXTURE. Although ADMIXTURE adopts the likelihood model embedded
in STRUCTURE, it runs considerably faster. Clearly, the above methods do not
provide formalsignificance tests for population differentiation. Thus, Patterson et al.
(2006) combined principal component analysis with Tracy-Widom theory to
investigate population structure. Meanwhile, Price et al. (2006) used principal
components analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and
controls in order to avoid spurious associations. However, it is difficult to correct the
differences of oil- and size-related traits across wild, landraces and bred soybeans
(evolutionary types). If the population structure is replaced by the above
evolutionary types, then GWAS works well in this study. Thus, we proposed the
evolutionary population structure model in GWAS.

To focus on the genetic effects of GmPDAT and GmDAGAT1 on seed oil- and size-
related traits in soybean, we measured six oil-related traits and four seed size traits
in 286 soybean accessions over four years, and incorporated evolutionary population
structure model into GWAS to investigate the association of variants on the whole
genome. The gene GmPDAT is responsible for the changes of seed oil- and size-
related traits, and its biological function was confirmed in transgenic soybeans. In
addition, we also observed some signs of the interaction between GmPDAT and
GmDAGAT1, although such evidence should be addressed in the future.
Materials and methods
Genetic populations, planting, genotyping and phenotyping
A total of 14 wild, 153 landrace and 119 domesticated soybeans from six geographic regions
in China, were planted at the Jiangpu Field Experiment Station of Nanjing Agricultural
University, Nanjing, China, with a complete randomized design with three replicates in 2011,
2012, 2014 and 2015. The plots were 1.5 m wide and 2 m long. All the 286 soybean
accessions were genotyped by sequencing and a total of 106013 SNPS were identified (Zhou
et al., 2015a). Twenty seeds from five plants in the middle row of each plot were measured
for seed length (SL), seed width (SW) and seed thickness (ST) using digital vernier calipers in
2011, 2012, 2014 and 2015. The 100-seed weight (100SW) trait was measured from 100
dried samples. For each accession, the SL, SW, and ST traits were averaged based on 20
seeds and 100SW for each accession was averaged based on three replicates. Six seed oil-
related traits, including seed oil content, palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids,
were measured by GC (gas chromatography) analysis. Details of the experiment were
described in Lisec et al. (2006) and Zuo et al. (2019).
We planted 171 recombinant inbred lines (RILS) from the orthogonal cross and 227 RILS from
the reciprocal cross of LSZZH (P1) with NN493-1 (P2) in three-row plots with a completely

randomized design at the Jiangpu Experiment Station of Nanjing Agricultural University in
2015. We genotyped for 11846 SNP markers and phenotyped for five TAGS in soybean
seeds. The design and management of field experiment were the same as those in the
above-mentioned GWAS. The TAGS levels were measured by LC-MS analysis (Gao et al.,
2017).
7



Single- and multi-trait GWAS methods
Only the SNPS, with minor allele frequency (MAF) 2 0.05 and missing rate < 0.1, were used in
the GWAS. Single-trait GWAS was conducted using GEMMA (Zhou & Stephens, 2012;
http://www. xlaborg/softwarehtm), EMMAX (Kang et al.
2010;
htps/genomesph.umich.umichedu/WIN/EMMAM and mrMLM (Wang et al., 2016;
https./Icran.r-proiect.org/web/packages/mrMLM.GUI/index.html). With the multi-locus
GWAS, we treated the three evolutionary types (wild, landrace and bred soybeans) as
population structure, and incorporated the structural effects into the mixed linear model of
GWAS, and the critical LOD scores for suggested and significant QTNS were set as 2.50 and
3.0, respectively (Zhang et al., 2019). Multi-trait GWAS was conducted using GEMMA (Zhou
& Stephens, 2014). The critical P-value for significant QTNS in the GEMMA and EMMAX
methods was determined by Bonferroni correction: a = 1/54,294 = 1.84e-05 (Xu et al.,
2018b; Zhang et al., 2019). The first VanRaden kinship matrix, proposed by VanRaden (2008)
and implemented via the GAPIT software (htp/izlab.net/GAPI), was used in the mrMLM
method.
All the SNP markers on Chr13 with MAF 2 0.05 and missing rate < 0.1 were used to detect
epistasis for seed oil- and size-related traits using PEPIS (Zhang et al., 2016;
hto/lbioinfo.noble.orgl Polygenic.an_/Home.gy. The critical LRT value for significant
interaction was set at 9.21.
Mapping QTLS for five TAGS insoybean seed
171 (orthogonal) and 227 (reciprocal) RILS from the cross between LSZZH and NN493-1 were
genotyped by SLAF-seq technology (Zuo et al., 2019) and measured by BIOTREE
(http: /www.biotree.cn/) for five TAGS [TAG (20:1/18:3/18:3), TAG (18:3/18:3/18:3), TAG
(14:0/18:3/18:3), TAG (20:2/18:2/18:2) and TAG (16:2/18:2/18:3)) in the soybean pods
harvested at 45 days after flowering (DAF) in 2015. All the 11,846 markers were assigned by
the MSTmap program into twenty soybean chromosomes (Zuo et al., 2019). The GCIM and
ICIM methods were used to detect QTLS for these TAGS using "QTLgCIMapping.Gur (Wang
et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2020) and "QTL IciMapping V4.1" (Li et al., 2007), respectively. The
orthogonal and reciprocal crosses were viewed as covariate and integrated into the genetic
model of QTL mapping. The scanning step was set at 1 CM. The critical LOD scores for
significant and suggested QTLS were set at 3.0 and 2.5, respectively.

Identification of candidate genes for seed oil- and size-related traits in soybean
As described by Liu et al. (2020), candidate genes for seed oil-related traits were mined in
three steps. First, we found all the genes between the 100 kb upstream and downstream
regions around each significant QTN. Then, we downloaded the KEGG annotation
htos/swxc.soxbase.om
and
the
soybean metabolic pathway database Intps/soxycsopaseong), and identified the
genes or their Arabidopsis homologous genes that were annotated with fatty acid
biosynthesis and seed size related pathways. Finally, four cultivated soybeans (accession
nos. 101, 236, 257 and 276), with high seed oil content (20.08 + 1.95 (%)) and large seed
(16.36 + 3.60 (g)), and two wild soybeans (accession nos. 265 and 272), with low seed oil
content (13.22 + 1.87 (%)) and small seed (2.45 + 0.34 (g)), were usedto conduct RNA-seq
analysis (Zhou et al., 2015a). The genes, with the annotations of fatty acid biosynthesis and
seed size related pathways and with differential expression levels between four cultivated
and two wild soybeans, were selected as candidate genes.
Genetic variants of GmPDAT and GmDAGAT1
The GmPDAT and GmDAGAT sequences were derived from four genomic sequences of two
wild soybeans (W05 and P1483463), one landrace (Williams 82, v1.1) and one cultivar (ZH13),
which were downloaded from Soybase htes/www.soybase.orgd. The variants of the two
genes across four genomes were obtained from the MUSCLE alignment via Genious v4.8.5
software (Kearse et al. 2012). Some variants for each gene were further confirmed by the
frequent changes of SNP alleles in 62 wild, 110 landrace and 130 improved soybeans in Zhou
et al. (2015b).
Development oftransgenic plants
Soybean total RNA was isolated from Williams 82 using the trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Foster
city, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and the RNAS were treated with
DNase I (Promega). The first-strand CDNA was then synthesized using M-MLV reverse
transcriptase (Promega). The open reading frames (ORFS) of GmPDAT (Glyma.13g108100)
were amplified from the CDNA of Williams 82 by regular PCR using gene-specific primers
(Table S1), and subcloned into the PMD-19 T vector (TaKaRa, Japan) for sequence
verification. The verified GmPDAT sequence was then cloned into the dicotyledon expression
vector PBWA(VJBS-ccdB vector (Biorun, China, http/www.biorun.net), which contains a
selection marker gene, bar (bialaphos resistance gene), using the ClonExpress Entry One
9



Step Cloning Kit. Then a 161-bp fragment of GmPDAT was amplified using a forward primer
GmPDAT-6F containing Eco321 restriction sites, and a reverse primer GmPDAT-6R containing
Eco321 restriction sites. A 200-bp hairpin construct fragment cloned from GmPDAT was
connected to the two 161-bp fragments. This PCR product was also cloned into PBWA(V)BS-
ccdB. The recombinant PCAMBIA3300-GMPDAT and PCAMBIA3300-RNAI- GmPDAT vectors
were transformed into Williams 82 [W82 (wild-type) background] via the Agrobacterium
tumefociens-mediated (GV3101) method (Zeng et al., 2004). The transgenic lines were
selected on MS medium containing 50 mg L1 kanamycin, bar gene PCR (543bp), and
LibertyLink strip detection (to detect the bar protein) (Invitrogen, Foster city, CA, USA). For
LibertyLink strip detection, a totalof 100 mg leaf tissue was collected and ground completely
in the bottom of a conically tapered 1.5 ml tube by pestle rotation, followed by the addition
of 0.5 mL of extraction buffer and a strip into the tube. After 5 minutes, those with two lines
(control and test lines) were positive for bar gene expression (Gao et al., 2015). The T2
homozygous transgenic lines (confirmed by the bar gene PCR, bar protein detection and
target gene real-time qPCR) were used forfurther analysis.
Expression analysis
The total RNA was isolated from seed of the T2 soybean transgenic lines and Williams 82 at
35 DAF. The extracted RNA was then treated with RNase-free DNase I (Promega, USA). The
RevertAid first strand CDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was used to
synthesize the CDNA. The first-strand CDNA mix was used as the template for RT-qPCR
(Reverse Transcription - quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction). Specific primers (Table S1)
were designed based on the assembled sequences of the GmPDAT and GmDAGAT1 genes.
The CDNA was used as a template for RT-qPCR using SYBR premix Ex taq (Takara;
htp/www.takara.com, The procedure was: step 1 95¬∞Cfor 3 min, step 2 95¬∞C for 10s, step
3 55¬∞Cfor 20s, step 4 72¬∞C for 20s, step 5 75¬∞C for 5s + Plate Read, step 6 GOTO step 2, 40
times andstep 7 Melt Curve 65.0 to 95¬∞C, increment 0.5¬∞C, 5s + Plate Read. Reactions were
run on a Bio-Rad CFX96 system. A soybean GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase) gene was amplified and used as the control in this experiment (Table S1).
Luciferase complementation image assays for the GmPDAT-by-GmDAGATI
interaction in Nicotiana benthamiana cells
The LCI assays for the interaction of GmPDAT with GmDAGAT1 in Nicotiana benthamiana
cells were described in Zhang et al. (2018). The procedure includes material preparation,
10



RNA and DNA isolation, primer design (Table S1) and conditions for PCR, luciferase
complementation image assays, and detection of interactions in vivo.
Cytological analysis
To investigate the seed cell size of the GmPDAT transgenic lines, seeds at 45 DAF and the
mature seeds were examined by serial paraffin sections. For each line, three seeds were
sampled from the six GmPDAT transgenic representative individuals and the controls,
respectively. The seeds were soaked in distilled water for 16 to 20 h at room temperature,
and then all the seeds were fixed in 50% FAA solution (formalin-acetic acid-alcohol solution).
After fixation for 20 to 24 h, using 60%, 70% and 80% ethanol gradient to dehydrate the FAA
solution for 1 h, and using 95% and 100% gradient ethanol to dehydrate for 30 min and
repeated one more time. The detailed experimental procedures were described in previous
studies (Yang et al., 2006, 2016). Semi-thin (2.5 um) sections were obtained using an
automatic microtome (Microm HM 360, Thermo), stained with 0.1%toluidine blue O for 30-
60 sec at room temperature, examined with a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope (Nikon, Japan)
and photographed under the "bright field" condition. The pictures were softened by
Photoshop CS6.
Microscopy analysis
To investigate the seed oil body size of the GmPDAT transgenic lines, the mature seeds were
examined by scanning electron microscope analyses. For each line, the seeds were first put
in the FAA Fixative. Pumped with a vacuum pump until they sank to the bottom. After 2 h at
room temperature, they were transferred to a 4 Crefrigerator, before being washed three
times (15 min each) in 0.1 M PBS. Then, the seeds were post-fixed with 1% Os04 in 0.1 M
PBS (pH 7.4)for 5hat room temperature. After removal of the Os04, they were rinsed three
times (15 mins each) in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4). The blocks were then washed, dehydrated
through an ethanol series of 30-100%, and embedded in EMbed 812 media. The detailed
experimental procedures were described in previous studies (Zhang et al., 2019). Slices (60-
80 nm) sections were obtained using an ultramicrotome (Leica UC7, Germany). Lastly,
sections were stained in uranyl acetate in pure ethanol for 15 min, rinsed with distilled
water, and then stained with lead citrate for 15 min, before rinsing with distilled water.
Sections were air-dried overnight at room temperature, then photographed under a TEM
(HT7700, Hitachi, Japan). The pictures were softened by Photoshop CS6.

Monte Carlo simulation studies
The simulated datasets of Wang et al. (2016) were partly adjusted in this study in order to
investigate the effect of soybean evolutionary types on QTN detection. The simulation is
briefly described here; for technical detail readers are referred to the original study (Wang et
al., 2016). The SNP genotypes were derived from the A. thaliana datasets (Atwell et al.,
2010), all the SNPS between 11226256 and 12038776 bp on Chr1, between 5045828 and
6412875 bp on Chr2, between 1916588 and 3196442 bp on Chr3, between 2232796 and
3143893 bp on Chr4, and between 19999868 and 21039406 bp on Chr5 were used to
conduct simulation studies. The sample size was 199, the number of lines in.Atwell et al.
(2010). Six QTNS were simulated and placed on the SNPS with an allele frequency of 0.30.
The sizes of the six QTNS, measured as the proportion of phenotypic variance contributed by
QTNS, were set at 0.10, 0.05, 0.05, 0.15, 0.05 and 0.05, respectively. The residual variance
was set at 10.0. All simulated data sets are available from the Dryad Digital Repository:
http:/ /dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.sk652. The phenotypes were simulated from the following
model y = u+ xb + E, where E L MVN,(0,10xI,)
iel
To simulate the population structure of wild, landrace and bred soybeans in this study, the
total phenotypic average of 10.0 in Wang etal. (2016) was adjusted into three averages of
evolutionary types: 10.0 + C x SD (standard deviation) for bred soybean (from the first to
100th individuals), 10.0 for landraces (from the 120th to 199th individuals), and 10.0 - C x SD
for wild soybean (from the 101thto 119th individuals), C= 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5, and SD = 4.6064.
Each sample was analyzed by the mrMLM method. The results for determining the number
of sub-populations in the matrices Q calculated from the markers related to the trait and all
the markers are listed in Table S2, and the Q matrices are listed in Table S3. For each
simulated QTN, we counted the samples in which the LOD statistic exceeded 3.0. A detected
QTN within 1 kb of the simulated QTN was considered a true QTN. The ratio of the number
of such samples to the total number of replicates (1000) represented the empirical power of
this QTN. The Type le error was calculated as the ratio of the number of false positive effects
to the total number of zero effects considered in the full model. To measure the bias of QTN
effect estimate, mean squared error (MSE) was defined as MSE i= 1
B)? where B
N iEl
is the estimate of B for each QTN in the ith sample, and N is the number of significant
QTNS.

Results
Distributions and comparisons of seed oil- and seed size-related traits
across wild, landrace and bred soybeans
Frequent distributions of seed oil- and size-related traits showed that these traits are
typical quantitative traits with large variation (Figs. S1 & S2; Table S4). Based on
evolutionary types, all the accessions were grouped into wild, landrace and bred
soybeans. Thus, analysis of variance was used to compare the differences across the
o
evolutionary types. Among 38 F tests, 35 were significant, indicating the existence of
an evolutionary population structure (E) in soybean (Tables 1 & S5).
Detection of QTNS and their candidate genes for seed oil- and size-
related traits in soybean
Single-trait GWAS and their candidate genes In Zhou et al. (2015a), all the
286 soybean accessions have been genotyped. In this study, we detected the
marker-trait associations on the whole genome using the mrMLM, GEMMA and
EMMAX methods. These results are shown in Figs. S3"S5. To reduce the false
positive rate, in this study we focused on the loci, identified commonly by the three
approaches, across various traits. Among these results, fifty-seven QTNS were
commonly found bythe three methods (Table S6).
Within the range of approximately 100 kb for each significant QTN, there were 1320
genes. Using the KEGG annotation Ontpes/bexycsobaseogp and the soybean
metabolic pathway database Ihtps/boyyc.soybaseoe, fifty-seven genes were
found to be annotated with lipids-synthesis- or seed-size-related pathways (Table
S6). Among the fifty-seven genes, nine were the same with those in Zhang et al.
(2016). Among the nine genes, Glyma.13g108108100/GmPDAT, Glyma.06g111100 and
Glyma.069039200 had significantly higher expression levels (P=0.004-0.041) in
cultivated soybeans than in wild soybeans (Table S6). In this study, we focused on
the gene GmPDAT. The reasons are as follows. First, PDAT1 in transgenic Arabidopsis
had inconsistent functions in fatty acid biosynthesis (Chen et al., 2016). Second,
13



GmPDAT was found to be associated with soybean seed oil-related traits in our
previous study (Liu et al., 2020).
GmPDAT is closely linked to the locus from 20676541 to 20704079 bp on Chr13 in
this study, and this locus was significantly associated with oleic acid, linolenic acid,
linoleic acid, seed thickness, seed length, seed width, and 100-seed weight in single-
trait GWAS (P-9.63e-10-1.63e-05; LOD-4.27-15.94) (Fig. 1; Table 2). Thus, we
suggest that GmPDATIS responsible for seed oil- and size-related traits.
In addition, the above locus is linked to the locus at 20532852 bp in a 200 kb region.
The latter was found by GEMMA (all the years) and EMMAX (2014) to be associated
significantly with linolenic acid (P-8.28e-09-1.58e-06; Table 2). Around this locus,
there were 34 genes. In the KEGG annotation Intes/sexcorcsoybaseorgp and the
soybean metabolic pathway database Ihtps/boycsoybaseorg). we found the
function of GmDAGAT1 (Glyma.139106100) to be diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1,
while Glyma.13g106300 was annotated with seed size related pathways, which are
hypersensitive to ABA (Table S7). DAGAT1 is shown to be related to seed oil content
and seed development in Arabidopsis as reported previously. In this study, analysis
of the RNA-sequences at 15, 25, 35 and 55 DAF identified GmDAGAT1 to be
differentially expressed between wild and cultivated soybeans, and the two
candidate genes had significantly higher expression levels in cultivated soybeans
than in wild soybeans (P=0.013; Tables S7 & S8), while Glyma.13g106300 had
significantly higher expression levels in cultivated soybeans than in wild soybeans (P-
value == 0.043; Table S7).
The expression patterns of GmDAGAT1 and GmPDAT at five stages in wild and
cultivated soybeans were similar to those of the genes GmWR1a and GmbZIP123,
but different from those of genes GmWRI1a, GmNFYA and GmBZR1 (Fig. S4).
Recently, we also found the associations of GmPDAT and GmDAGAT1 with soybean
seed oil-related traits (Liu et al., 2020) and TAGS (see Discussion). Thus, GmPDAT and
GmDAGAT1 are considered as candidate genes for soybean lipid metabolism, while
Glyma.13g106300 is considered as a candidate gene for seed size related traits.

Multi-trait GWAS To further validate the results of the single-trait GWAS, a
multi-trait GWAS was performed using the genome-wide efficient mixed model
association (GEMMA) (Zhou & Stephens, 2014). The locus at 20532852 bp was found
to be associated simultaneously with linolenic acid, ST and 100SW (P=9.45e-
10-5.72e-06), and the locus between 20704034 and 20719806 bp was found to be
associated simultaneously with oleic acid, oil content, seed length and width in some
cases (Fig. 1b; Table S9). In summary, the above two loci on Chr13 were foundto be
associated with seed oil- and size-related traits. The results further confirmed the
results from single-trait GWAS.
Canonical correlation analysis of seed oil- and seed size-related traits
Canonical correlation between the oil- and size-related traits was significant (P-
values < 0.0001) and the coefficients were between 0.607 and 0.754, indicating the
correlation of seed oil-related traits with seed size-related traits (Table S10).
Meanwhile, in simple correlation analysis between each pair of seed oil- and size-
related traits, the stable correlations of seed linolenic acid with seed width, seed
thickness, 100-seed weight and seed length, and those of seed oleic acid with the
above last three seed size-related traits support the associations of the loci at
20532852 and 20704079 (bp) simultaneously with seed oleic acid, linolenic acid,
seed width, seed thickness, 100-seed weight and seed length (Table S11). The
pleiotropic effects of the above two QTNS are the genetic foundation of the
correlation (Tables 2 & S11).
Domesticated evidences ofcandidate genes for seed oil- and size-related
traits To further confirm the two candidate genes of seed oil- and size-related
traits, we analyzed the variants of the two genes across wild, landrace and bred
soybeans. As a result, five SNPS were found to exist in GmPDAT. Among these
variants, one was in the upstream of 26 bp in the 5'UTR, one was located in the
5'UTR, and three were located in the 3'UTR (Fig. 2a). Four SNPS located in its UTR
were further confirmed in 302 soybean accessions (Zhou et al., 2015b), in which
15



there were large allelic frequency differences between wild and cultivated soybeans
(Fig. 2d). In the same way, four variants were found to exist in GmDAGAT1. Among
these variants, one was located in the upstream of 30 bp in 5'UTR, one was located
in the 3'UTR, and two were located in the CDS region (Figs. 2b & 2c). The SNP in the
3'UTR was further confirmed in 302 soybean accessions (Zhou et al., 2015b), in
which there were large allelic frequency difference between wild and cultivated
soybeans (Fig. 2d). Clearly, the two genes are involved in domestication. As we
know, there are significant differences of seed oil- and size-related traits among the
three kinds of soybeans. Thus, the above domestication evidence ofthe two genes
support the associations of the two genes with seed oil- and size-related traits.
GmPDAT and GmDAGAT1 expression in transgenic soybeans
To identify the function of GmPDAT, we performed transgenic experiments by (1)
overexpressing the GmPDAT production and (2) interfering the GmPDAT production
under the control of the CaMV35S promoter in soybean cultivar Williams 82. We
cloned the GmPDAT gene in a binary expression vector with two CaMV35S
promoters. The GmPDAT gene and the bar gene (glufosinate resistant gene) were
each driven by the 35S promoter. The T2 seeds from both of three independent lines
overexpressing GmPDAT (OX-GmPDAT) and the three independent lines with RNAi
GmPDAT (RNAi-GMPDAT) were confirmed by the bar gene PCR, bar protein
detection (Fig. S7) and target gene real-time qPCR (Fig. 3). Table S12 shows that the
expression level of GmPDAT was 5.93-6.81, 0.80-1.29, and 2.68 in OX-GmPDAT,
RNAI-GMPDAT and the control lines (wild-type, WT), respectively. The expression
level is significantly higher in OX-GmPDAT than in WT lines (P-1.66e-04-3.26e-03)
and the expression level is significantly lower in RNAI-GMPDAT than in WT lines (P=
5.38e-06-8.24e-05) (Fig. 3a). The expression level of GmDAGAT1 was 1.84-2.39,
1.67-2.00, and 1.91 in OX-GmPDAT, RNAi-GMPDAT and WT lines, respectively, and
the differences are not significant between OX-GMPDAT and WT lines (P=0.06-0.18)
and between RNAi-GMPDAT and WT lines (P=0.07-0.21) (Fig. 3b, Table S12). In
other words, the expression of GmDAGAT1 did not change while the expression level
of GmPDAT changed. This means that GmPDATmay not regulate GmDAGAT1.

We measured the seed oil content, the five fatty acids, and all seed size related traits
(SL, SW, ST and 100SW) for the T2 seeds of the above-mentioned GmPDAT
transgenic, WT and negative control lines. The results are listed in Table S6. Seed oil
contents in OX-GmPDAT, RNAI-GMPDAT and WT lines are 194.10-222.53,
140.03-160.89 and 177.86 mg/g, respectively; the seed linoleic acids in OX-GmPDAT,
RNAI-GMPDAT and WT lines were 106.99-"120.56, 72.26"91.02 and 95.93 mg/g,
respectively; the seed linolenic acids in OX-GmPDAT, RNAi-GMPDAT and WT lines are
14.90-18.64, 9.40-11.98, and 13.02 mg/g, respectively. Although no significant trait
difference was observed between WT and the negative control lines, seed oil
content, seed linoleic acid and seed linolenic acid were significantly higher in OX-
GmPDAT than in WT lines and significantly lower in RNAi-GMPDAT than in WT lines
(Fig. 3e, Table S12).
The trait values of 100SW are 19.75"19.97, 17.54"18.15 and 18.46 g, respectively,
for OX-GmPDAT, RNAi-GMPDAT and WT lines, indicating significantly larger values in
OX-GmPDAT lines than in WT lines (P-2.27e-03-0.01) and almost significantly
smaller in RNAi-GMPDAT lines than in WT lines (P=0.02-0.07) (Fig. 3d). In terms of
SL, the trait values are 7.82-8.12, 7.24*7.27 and 7.32 mm, respectively, for OX-
GmPDAT, RNA-GMPDAT and WT lines, being very significantly longer in OX-GMPDAT
lines than in WT lines (P-2.07e-11-7.2e-11) and no significant difference between
RNAI-GMPDAT and WT lines (P=0.07-0.15). The values of trait SW in OX-GmPDAT,
RNAI-GMPDAT and WT lines are 6.87-7.05, 6.48-6.54 and 6.59 mm, respectively,
indicating very significantly higher values in OX-GmPDAT lines than in WT lines
(P-2.97e-7-8.37e-7) and no significant difference between RNAi-GMPDAT and WT
lines (P=0.06-0.22). Finally, the values of the ST trait are 5.47-5.64, 5.02-5.38 and
5.54 mm, for OX-GmPDAT, RNAI-GMPDAT, and WT lines, respectively, indicating no
significant difference between OX-GMPDAT and WT lines (P=0.17-0.19) but
significantly lower in RNAI-GMPDAT lines than in WT lines (P-2.3e-07-0.01) (Fig. 3f;
Table S12).

Comparison of the E + K model with the others in GWAS using Monte
Carlo simulation studies
The purpose of the simulation studies is to demonstrate the advantage of the
evolutionary population structure (E) model, namely the E + K model. To simulate
the soybean evolutionary population structure, we first set the trait mean at 10.0 in
the first simulated dataset of Wang et al. (2016) and then adjusted three averages of
the wild, landrace and bred soybeans, being 10.0 + C X standard deviation (SD), 10,
and 10.0 - C x SD, respectively, where SD = 4.6064 and C takes three differentvalues:
0.5, 1.0 and 1.5. The number of individuals is 1"100 for bred soybean, 120r199 for
landraces and 101"119 for wild soybean. Under each level of C, all the simulations
were replicated 1000 times. Each sample was analyzed under five models: (1) only
polygenic background control (the K model), (2) only evolutionary population
structure control (the E model), (3) population structure Q from all the markers
related to the trait at the 0.05 level of significance and polygenic background
controls (the Q1 + K model), (4) population structure Q from all the markers and
polygenic background controls (the Q2 + K model), and (5) evolutionary population
structure and polygenic background controls (the E + K model). The power of QTN
detection, mean squared error (MSE) of QTN effect, and false positive rate (FPR)
were used to measure the effect of various genetic models, and these results are
listed in Table S13. To demonstrate the objective of the simulation experiments, the
E + K model was compared with all the other models. In the case of C=0.5, as a result,
the average powers of QTN detection over the six QTNS are 54.55, 38.53, 38.95,
54.08, and 67.30 (%), respectively, for the above five models; the average MSES of
QTN effects are 0.1206, 0.2003, 0.1231, 0.1410, and 0.0936, respectively; the FPRS
are 0.0212, 0.1037, 0.0272, 0.0210, and 0.0176 (%), respectively (Fig. 4). Using paired
t (or u) test, the E + K model has almost significantly higher statistical powers, lower
MSES, and lower false positive rate than the others (Table 3), indicating the best
performances of the E + K model. The same trends are also observed in the cases of
C= 1.0 and 1.5. The evolutionary population structure method was also used to re-
analyzed a famous rice grain width dataset in Wang et al. (2018). As a result, five
18



additionally known genes, along with two genes detected by Wang et al. (2018),
were identified (Fig. S8; Table S14). Therefore, the E + K model is the best one.
Discussion
Two significant advances have been reported in this study. First, the biological
function of the gene GmPDAT is reported for the first time in soybean. As described
above, GmPDAT plays a critical role in the increase of seed oil- and size-related traits
in the lines overexpressing GmPDAT and in the decrease of seed oil- and size-related
traits in RNAi-GMPDAT lines. In Arabidopsis, meanwhile, the biological functions of
the gene AtPDAT in St√¢hl et al. (2004), Mhaske et al. (2005) and Marmon et al.
(2017) are significantly different from those in Zhang et al. (2009), Fan et al. (2013)
and Pan et al. (2013). Second, simulated and real data analyses showed that the E +
K model can increase the statistical power of QTN detection in GWAS as compared
with the currently-adopted Q + K model. This will provide a new approach to mine
new genes in animal, plant and human genetics.
Detection of pleiotropic genes inasmallregion
As described by Kroymann & Mitchell-Olds (2005), our knowledge of complex trait
variation is limited to QTL ofrelatively large effects, and it is very difficult to detect
small QTNS, especially in a small region. Here we present an outstanding example on
how to detect pleiotropic genes in a small region. First, we replaced the Q matrix by
the E matrix in the mixed linear model of GWAS. If the Q matrix is incorporated into
the mixed linear model of our multi-locus GWAS methods, no QTNS were identified
in this small region. Then, we used several single-trait GWAS analyses, and multi-trait
analyses to cross-examine these QTNS in the small region. In this study, two loci
were repeatedly identified by the above approaches to be associated with seed oil-
and size-related traits. Subsequent genomic function analysis, and expression level
analysis in OX-GmPDAT, RNAi-GMPDAT and control lines helped us to reliably
determine whether the two loci were truly associated with seed oil- and size-related
traits in soybean. Recently, another pleiotropic and domestication gene
19



GmSWEET10a/b for seed size, oil content and protein content in soybean has been
reported (Wang et al., 2020).
Molecular mechanism of pleiotropic effect of GmPDAT for seed oil- and
size-related traits in soybean
Mapping QTLS for five TAGS in soybean RILS To understand the mechanism
of pleiotropic GmPDAT on seed oil-related traits, we genotyped 171 (orthogonal) and
227 (reciprocal) RILS from the cross between LSZZH and NN493-1 for 11846 SNPS,
and measured phenotypic values of five TAGS on seeds 45 DAF (Fig. S9; Table S15).
These datasets were used to identify QTLS for the five TAGS using GCIM and ICIM. As
a result, one QTL around GmDAGAT1 and two QTLS around GmPDAT were identified
(Fig. S10arc; Table S14).
Histocytological comparison of GmPDAT transgenic soybean with its
wild-type Because seed integument size influences final seed size, which is
determined by cell proliferation and cell expansion, the outer integument cells were
observed in the seeds of WT Col-0 and GmPDAT overexpressing lines. The cell
lengths and widths increased 15.7% and 9.0% in the mature seeds, and 14.7% and
22.0% in the premature seeds (45-DAF), respectively, in OX-30 transgenic lines than
in WT Col-0 lines. However, the cell lengths and widths decreased 25.2% and 23.5%
in the mature seeds, and 9.0% and 12.8% in the premature seeds (45-DAF),
respectively, in RNAI-16transgenic lines than in WT Col-0 lines. The result indicates
that the cell size of OX-GmPDAT seeds is significantly larger than that of WT Col-0
seeds (Fig. S10d"s), which is consistent with the study by Hirshfield et al. (1993).
Plants often store oils in the form of TAGS in seeds and fruits (Carlsson et al., 2011;
Lu et al., 2011), and the TAGS are known to be produced by DGAT and PDAT (Zhang
et al., 2009); Zhang et al. (2009) proved in Arabidopsis that DGAT1 encodes a major
enzyme contributing to the accumulation of seed TAGS, acting together mainly with
PDAT. These results are consistent with our QTL mapping results, which show the
two QTLS (20573761 and 20606048 bp; 20620950 to 20775650 bp) are very close to
the candidate genes GmDAGAT1 and GmPDAT. In our GWAS and GmPDAT transgenic
20



soybean results, GmDAGAT1 and GmPDAT are associated with seed oil- and size-
related traits. In our histocytological results, the seeds of lines overexpressing
GmPDAT are larger than their wild type equivalent. We also compared the oil bodies
(OBS) of OX, WT and RNAi seeds using transmission electron microscopy. In the
mature seeds, the OBs of OX seeds showed typically spherical and ovoid structures
and were distributed mostly between protein bodies (Fig. S10t). Moreover, OX seed
cells contained apparently bigger OBs than WT and RNAi, and the seed cells in RNAi-
16 appear to contain the smallest OBs (Fig. S10u). Therefore, GmPDAT increased
TAGS and eventually increased the seed oil. More oil requires a large space to store
the oil and thus leads to increased cell length and cell width in the seeds of
overexpressing GmPDATlines.
The E + K model increases the statistical power of QTN detection
Population structure is widely used in GWAS to control population stratification.
Generally speaking, it is expressed by the matrix Q, which is frequently calculated
from some or all the markers. In the Q matrix, each element is a posteriori
-
probability that the ith accession belongs to the kth subpopulation. In this study, the
population structure is replaced by an evolutionary population structure. In the
evolutionary population structure (the E matrix), each element (eik) is composed of
one or zero. If the ith accession belongs the second evolutionary type, SO ei2 = 1 and
ek=Ofor k + 2.
Wild, landrace and bred soybeans are three evolutionary types and significant
differences across these types exist for seed oil- and size-related traits (Table S4).
Although the Q matrix calculated from all the markers can be used to correct these
population structure differences, the results are unsatisfactory in this study. Thus,
we replaced the Q matrix by the E matrix in GWAS. Its advantages have been
demonstrated via Monte Carlo simulation studies and real data analysis. The
possible reason is that the E model reflects the evolutionary process and the
differences across various evolutionary types. Thus, more information is obtained
from the E + K model. After the evolutionary population structure effects are
21



removed, in statistics, the intra-allelic variance is smaller than that when the
evolutionary population structure effects are ignored, as shown below,
d-Ewutol-
i=l
where Hi, o7 and W, are the means, the variances and the proportions of the wild (
i=1), landrace (i=2) and domesticated (i=3) soybeans, and u is the overall
mean. The above larger intra-allelic variance can significantly decrease the statistical
power of QTN detection. This may be one reason for the low power in QTN detection
for complex traits.
As we know, the Q matrix is calculated from genome-wide marker information. The
purpose is to capture all genes for the trait of interest. However, we do not know
where these genes are located. Therefore, one selects all markers potentially
associated with the trait of interest to calculate the Q matrix. In genomic selection,
He et al. (2019) compared the predicted accuracies from four marker sets, being all
the unique QTNS, statistically stable QTNS, stable and large-effect QTNS and all the
related markers. They found that the predicted accuracy is as high as 0.92 when all
unique QTNS are used. This implies that the current method of calculating the Q
matrix is not optimal to some extent and may explain why the two loci were not
detectable when the Q matrix was used. More importantly, the results from the Q1 +
K model are not better than those from the E + K model.
Asian, white and black ethnic groups are three evolutionary types of humans and
their complex traits and diseases have significant differences across groups (Table
$16). In previous GWAS studies, these evolutionary differences were not fully
controlled, although the Q matrix has been adopted. Evolutionary population
structure exists in all species and incorporation of such structure effects into the
GWAS model is necessary in animal, plant and human genetics. The evolutionary
population structure is suitable for all the populations having evolutionary
population structures. If all individuals in the GWAS population have a similar
evolutionary type, the Q matrix correction may be sufficient.

Some signs of the epistasis between GmPDAT and GmDAGAT1
The PEPIS program was used to detect the epistatic effect between the above two
loci (chr13-20532852 and chr13-20719806) for seed oil- and size-related traits
collected. Significant epistatic effects were detected and they are responsible for the
variation in linolenic acid (LRT= 24.37, 2014; LRT=11.52, 2012), and seed thickness
(LRT=10.80, 2011).
To further validate the above interaction, the interaction analysis for the candidate
genes GmDAGAT1 and GmPDAT was performed. Molecular structure analysis of
gene interaction based on the program STRING (htps/Sstring-db.orgi/D indicates the
existence of epistasis; the statistic was 0.75, which was significantly larger than the
medium confidence of 0.40. More importantly, luciferase complementation image
assays (LCI) validated the protein interaction between GmPDAT and GmDAGAT1.
With the co-infiltration of recombinant strain combination N-GmPDAT + C-
GmDAGAT1 into N. benthamiana fresh leaves, we observed a strong fluorescent
signal in the epidermal cells, compared with those from control groups, suggesting
GmPDAT and GmDAGAT1 can be combinedtogether in vivo (Fig. S11).
Conclusions
Two QTNS for seed oil- and size-related traits in soybean were identified in a small
interval using an evolutionary population structure model. Around the two QTNS,
two candidate genes GmPDAT and GmDAGAT1 have been proved to be
domestication genes. The biological function of GmPDAT is reported for the first
time to be associated with acyl-lipid metabolism in soybean, while the biological
function of candidate gene Glyma.13g106300 for seed size-related traits will be
investigated in the future. Although there are some signs of the interaction between
GmPDAT and GmDAGAT1, this evidence should be addressed in the future. This
study provides a new approach for identifying pleiotropic genes.

Fig. 1. Significant QTNS (a and b) and their candidate genes (c) for soybean seed oil- and size-
related traits on a small region of chromosome 13 using single- (a) and multi-trait (b) genome-
wide association studies. The critical P-value of significant QTNS (a and b) was set at 1/m where
m = 54294 and marked by horizontal lines. These QTNS are marked by dots with various colors (a
and b). In the structures of GmPDAT and GmDAGAT1, exons, introns and untranslated regions
(UTRS) are indicated by red boxes, thin black lines and black boxes, respectively (c).

Fig. 2. The variants of GmPDAT (a) and GmDAGAT (b and c) across four genomes of two
wild soybeans (W05 and P1483463), one landrace (Williams 82, v1.1) and one cultivar
(ZH13), and the SNP allele frequencies (d) in 62 wild, 110 landrace and 130 improved
soybeans of Zhou et al. (2015b). The GmPDAT and GmDAGAT sequences were derived from
four genomic sequences of the above four accessions, which were downloaded from
Soybase (hntos/www.soybase.om) The variants of the two genes across four genomes
were obtained from the MUSCLE alignment of Genious v4.8.5 software (Kearse et al. 2012).
GmDAGATIN genome v1.1 is GmDAGAT1 in genome v2.0.

Fig. 3. Real-time PCR analysis (a: GmPDAT; b: GmDAGT1), seeds (c; scale bar: 10 mm), and their
oil- andisize-related traits (def) of GmPDAT transgenic soybean. WT: non-transgenic cultivar
Williams 82; negative: control plants transformed with empty vector; OX: GmPDAT
overexpressed lines; RNAi: RNAi transgenic lines. Seven to eleven seeds from each T2 transgenic
line were used to measure seed oil-related traits, the results from three lines are shown as mean
+ standard deviation, and n= 3. * and **: the 0.05 and 0.01 levels of significance, respectively.
The t-test was used to test the significant differences of 100-seed weight (d), linolenic acid,
linoleic acid, oil content (e), seed length, width and thickness (f) between OX (or RNAi) and WT.
The raw datasets are listed in Supplemental Datasets 1"3.
