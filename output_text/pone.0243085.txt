humans during its 4500 year-long history of domestication [1]. In addition to its nutritional
value, the soybean contains a variety ofbioactive phytochemicals such as saponin,lecithin, iso-
flavone, anthocyanin and many others [2]. Among other phytochemicals, anthocyanin is one
ofthe key components that exert antioxidant effects and determine the seed colors of soybean.
A recent study reported that dark-colored seeds (i.e., seeds with higher anthocyanin contents)
had positive effects for the grain storage compared to light-colored seeds [3], because anthocy-
anins and other polyphenolic compounds contributed to resisting stresses during the storage
[4,5]. As aresult, longer seed storability leads to beneficial effects on seed germination, growth
vigor, nutritional contents, and overall seed quality. Thus, the seed color should be considered
one ofthe most critical qualitative traits for grain crops like soybeans. The seed coat of the soy-
bean can be represented by four colors; black, brown, yellow, green, and additionally mottled.
Among various cultivated soybeans, yellow soybeans are currently the most predominant On
the other hand, black soybeans are recently attracting more interest due to their antioxidant
properties and flavors [6].
It is known that soybean seed color is controlledby multiple loci of moderate complexity.
So far, at least nine genomic loci (I, R, T, W1, O, D1, D2, qSC1 and psbM) have been reported
[6-11], many of which are involved in anthocyanin-derived pigmentation pathways. For
example, Ilocus harbors a cluster of chalcone synthase (CHS) genes, which are the key regula-
tory enzymes ofthe flavonoid pathway [12]. Four alleles (I, i,f,) have been identified within
the Ilocus, and they participate in controlling the colors ofhilum and seed coat. Soybeans with
the dominant Iallele result in colorless (ie., yellow or green) seed coats, whereas soybeans har-
boring the i allele exhibit colored (i.e., black or brown) coats. The i allele controls restricted
pigmentation to the hilum, thereby resulting in soybean seeds with a colorless seed coat and
coloredhilum, while the * allele restricts pigments to the saddle region [13]. The Tlocus con-
tains flavonoid 3-hydroxylase (F3'H) and may control pubescence color. Soybeans with domi-
nant Tallele give rise to brown pubescence while those with the recessive t allele inherit gray
pubescence [7]. A R2R3 MYB transcription factor (R2R3 MYB TF) was reported as a key
player ofthe R locus that was associated with a brown seed coat and hilum [10]. W1 locus is
presumed to encode favonoid-35hydroxylase (F3'5H). Under a iRt genetic background,
dominant W1 and recessive wl alleles are supposed to produce imperfect black and buff seed
coats, respectively [11,14]. Both D1 and D2loci, known as homologs ofthe STAY-GREEN
(SGR), were revealed to be duplicated by recent whole genome duplication ofthe soybean and
correlated with chlorophyll degradation [9,15]. Double-recessive mutant (did1d2d2) caused
chlorophyll retention and exhibited the green seed coat color [9]. The qSC1 locus is also
known to be associated with a green seed coat color. However, genes associated with the corre-
sponding phenotype have not yet been identified [6]. Another study reported that the psbM
gene encoded one ofthe small subunits of photosystem II and that it was associated with the
mechanism of chlorophyll degradation. Soybeans with the recessive allele of psbM gene are
maternally inherited because this gene resides in the chloroplast [8].
Since the advent ofnext-generation sequencing (NGS) technology and production ofthe
whole genome reference sequence of soybeans [16],many soybean cultivars, landraces, and
wild types have been sequenced for the purpose of genome-wide analyses. Currently, a total of
3021 accessions derived from whole genome resequencing (WGR) are available in the public
domain and account for atotal data amount of23.87 TB (the International Nucleotide
Sequence Database Collaboration or INSDC: http:l/www. insdc.org/) [17]. Phenotypic data of

Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a useful and powerful means by which we can
identify genes and/or loci associated with traits ofinterest across the entirety of genomes. Con-
ventionally, GWAS is performed using genomic variants such as single nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPS) and short insertion/deletion (InDels) obtained by mapping NGS reads against
the reference genome. This type of'reference-based" GWAS (rbGWAS) analysis fully relies on
the completeness and correctness ofthe reference genome information. Due to this reason,
rbGWAS may sometimes have limitations in applying the analytical tool for some species
whose reference genomes are not available or are incomplete. Although rbGWAS has success-
fully served to discover numerous trait-associated variants [18-20] in the past, considerable
cases of phenotype-to-genotype parallelism' could not be explained due to a problem known
as 'missing heritability' [21].
To effectively overcome the limitation in rbGWAS methodology, a new approach, namely
'reference-free GWAS or rfGWAS' that does not require the reference genome, has recently
been developed [22-27]. This analytical approach employs all possible sub-nucleotides, called
'k-mers', with optimized lengths, all ofwhich can be identified within the whole genome NGS
reads. Depending on the presence or absence ofk-mers, researchers can identify variants and
determine their types. It appears that the majority ofrfGWAS approaches have been applied to
bacterial genomes [22-25], while being rarely appliedto human genomes [26]. Recently, plant
genomes have been analyzed with these methods [27].
In this study, we intended to employ dual approaches, in terms ofanalytical means and
data combinations, to accomplish precision analysis in genome-wide detection of genes and/
orlociassociated with the pigmentation of fsoybean seeds. Towards this direction, k-mer-
based rfGWAS in the soybean genome was employedto complement rbGWAS and to ensure
discovery of missing trait-associated genomic fractions, by involving a wide array ofNGS data
combined with in-house-generated and public data of WGR, RNA-seq and small RNAS.
Materials and methods
Plant materials, DNA extraction and NGS sequencing
A total of43 Korean soybean accessions, including 40 cultivars and 3 landraces (seed coat col-
ors; 22 black, 2brown, 16 yellow and 3 green) were chosen for a new WGR data production.
All ofthe seedmaterials were acquired from the Rural Development Administration (RDA)-
Genebank Information Center (GBIC; htrp/bwowgencbankgak) in Korea. Detailed infor-
mation on each accession is available in S1 Table. Sterilized seeds were sown in 1 L pots and
grown under greenhouse conditions. Leaves at the R1-R2 growth stages (i.e., during the flower
development) were sampled for DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Plant
DNA isolation kit (GeneAll, Seoul, ROK) according to themanufacturer's protocol. Purity and
integrity ofDNA were inspected by A260/A280 absorbance ratio and agarose gel electrophore-
sis, respectively. The sequencing libraries of each accession, with an average insert size of550
bp, were constructed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Illumina, San Diego, CA,
USA).Using the Illumina HiSeq4000 NGS platform, paired-end reads were produced at the
Macrogen Inc. (ntp/how.mactogen.com, Seoul, Korea).
Collection of ENGS data and phenotype information
To avoid false positive variants generated by incorrect mapping due to highly duplicated soy-
bean genome (approximately 75%) [28], only paired-end reads were collected from the

European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, htp/wwwebiacullena) and the National Agricultural
Biotechnology Information Center (NABIC, http/nabicrdago.krl) with following search
options; library strategy == WGS, depth X 5.0, read length X 90bp. As a result, 662 and 121
WGR data sets were obtained from ENA and NABIC, respectively. Phenotype data was
retrieved mainly from GRIN (itpe/hwwars-gringow), RDA-GBIC (https/www.ars-grin.
gov/) DB and related literatures as well. To identify alternative splicing by nucleotide varia-
tions, RNA-seq paired end reads were collected from ENA with following parameter adjust-
ment; library strategy == RNA-Seq, depth N 5.0, readlength X 90bp.
WGR read mapping, variant calling and annotation
Trimmomatic (atrp/lwww.usadellab: O ms 1 as e-trimmomatic, Version: 0.36) was used to
remove low quality regions of raw reads with the following parameter options (Leading:3
Trailing:3 SlidingWindow:4:5 Minlen:90) according to the previous report [29]. G. max Wil-
liams 82 assembly v2.0 was downloaded from the Phytozome @mpglphyroomeigadoc.gon
Wpalheahasnhla.OnzGmas which contained only nuclear genome information,
and was used as the reference genome for mapping. For other sub-organelle genome informa-
tion, data for mitochondrion Ompulhwwndialinanhgeiimcm-NCG8SI) and
chloroplast (https/www.ncbinim.nihgov/nucore/NC.007942.1) genomes were separately
downloaded from the NCBI. These nuclear and sub-organellar genome information were
merged together and used for the whole genome backbone for mapping WGR reads. This way,
we intended to avoid any possibility oferroneous mapping that might be causedby non-
nuclear DNA. Paired-end reads were mapped to the backbone reference genome using Bur-
rows Wheeler Aligner (BWA) program (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.netl, Version:
0.7.15-r1140) with default options [30]. Overall mapping rates were calculated by Samtools
software (http.l/isamtools.sourceforge.net/, Version: 1.3.1). Samples with <80% mapping rates
were removed according to previously reported guideline [31]. Picard software (https:/l
brodinstiutegthabialvand, Version: 2.8.3) was used to sort mapping outcomes and to
remove duplicated reads.
Reads mapped around InDel sites were realigned using the IndelRealigner program, and
scores for base-pair quality were recalibrated using the BaseRecalibrator program, both of
which were available as package programs in Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, https:Il
ehwuschoadinstmicopg/pat, Version: 3.7-0-gcfedb67) [32]. Variant discovery was con-
ducted using HaplotypeCaller in the GATK package. To minimize false positive variant calling,
preliminary raw variants were further filtered out with following parameter options; QD < 5,
FS N 30, SOR N 3.0, MQ < 30, MQRankSum < -3.5, MQRankSum > 3.5, ReadPosRankSum
< -2.0 and ReadPosRankSum > 2.0. For the purposes ofannotating genes and evaluating
effects ofvariant, Sptloepliepdaeudhgunt, Version: 4.3t) was employed [33].
Population and phylogenetic analysis
In order to interpret population structure of 438 soybean accessions, a total of 5717575 SNPs
were used and calculated with analysis options ofMAF>0.05 and 10% maximum missing
data. Initially, a neighbor joining tree was constructed using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics
Analysis (MEGA, https./www.megasoftware.netl, Version: 7.0.26). A consensus tree with
1000 bootstrap replicates was plotted for high-precision evolutionary relationship analysis
[34]. To infer the population structure, fastSTRUCTURE (htps/rajanil.github.io
fastStructurel, Version: 1.0) program was used and analyzed using the variational Bayesian
framework. The fastSTRUCTURE program was implemented initially with simple basic
option for K values ranging from 1to 10. The 'chooseK.py' script was used to determine

optimal number of genetic components, followed by 'distruct.py' script to visualize admixture
proportions [35].
Reference-based GWAS analysis
For the purposes of precisely searching for trait-associated variants, two sets ofNGS-derived
data were employed for the GWAS analyses; 1) WGR data from 438 soybean accessions, 2)
Illumina Infinium SoySNP50K BeadChip SNP data [36] derived from 20087 soybean acces-
sions. The SoySNP50K SNP data were downloaded directly from the SoyBase (http:l/soybase.
org/snps). To remove low quality andless informative variants, variants with MAF<0.05 and
10% minimum missing data were filtered out. Data filtration was able to identify a atotal of
6948411 and 36587 nucleotide variants from the WGR and array chip data sets, respectively.
GWAS analysis was conducted using the Efficient Mixed-Model Association eXpedited pro-
gram (EMMAX, Meplgenefiscudalwiemmw, Version: 20120210) [37]. The kinship
matrix was measuredby EMMAX-IBS. In order to implement GWAS, EMMAX program
requires a binary input of data; for example, 1) quantification of contrasting qualitative pheno-
types, 2) classification ofphenotypic characters into either 'case' or control'. In case oftraits
related to more than two phenotypes, EMMAX may give rise to a problem for the GWAS anal-
ysis. To circumvent such a problem, all possible binary combinations ('case' or'control)of
phenotypes were made and used for the GWAS analyses. To estimate the significance thresh-
old ofGWAS results, the Bonferroni correction method was employed.
3-D structure molecular modeling of the CaaXEP protein
3-D molecular structures ofthe CaaXEP protein were predicted using the stand-alone package
ofI-TASSER server with default options [38]. In order for the molecular modeling, protein
sequences were fed into the program after removing the chloroplast transit peptide sequences.
Among five predicted models suggested by the I-TASSER, the best structure was selected on
the basis ofthe number of decoy for robust ranking factor. The resulting data in the pdb file
format were visualized using the PyMOL program [39]. The secondary structures (i.e., helix,
sheet and loop) were drawn by the 'cartoon and surface' mode within the overall structural
integrity ofcorresponding 3-D structure.
K-mer-based reference-free association analysis
To conduct reference-free association analysis, K-mer Counter (KMC) software (http://sun.
aei.polsl.pl/kmcl, Version: 3.0) was used to count all possible k-mers in all WGR reads with
following parameter optionss-k31, -m256 [40]. K-mers counted only once was filtered out to
obtain accurate data set, because they might contain sequencing errors. Resulting k-mers were
combined and converted into variant call format (VCF) data using in-house program (avail-
able at github.com/kimz14/Kmer-to-VCF, Subsequently, GWAS analysis was performed
using PLINK program with following parameter options; -allow-extra-chr,-allow-no-sex-
assoc (http.lrz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink, Version: 1.90b5.2) [41].
mRNA-seq mapping analysis
To investigate the effects ofnucleotide variants on structural changes in genes, mRNA-seq
reads were mapped onto the backbone reference genome using the STAR program (https:/1
gthub.com@ledobinSTAR, Version: 2.7.0d) [42]. To figure out alternatively spliced gene
structures ofinterest, RNA-seq reads were assembled into transcripts using StringTie program
(htps/ccbjhu.edulsoftwarelstringtie', Version: 1.3.3b) with parameter -G [43]. Finally,

(IGV; htpel/befwarchroadinstitutecorglefwarceigva Version: 2.4.7 [44]. The Sashimi plot
was generated by IGV with a parameter ofminimum junction coverage 5.
Small RNA-seq mapping analysis
Because adapter sequences used for generation of small RNA-seq reads were heterogeneous
and were not available in public domains, they were searched by k-mer-based method and
subsequently removed from the small RNA-seq reads using in-house program. The sizes of
trimmed small RNA-seq reads ranged from 14to 43 nucleotides with a major peak around
21-24nucleotides in length. Trimmed small RNA-seq reads were mapped onto the backbone
reference using STAR program with the option of'no mismatches allowed' [42]. Subsequently,
the python language was used for visualizing alignmentresults [45].
Isolation and quantification ofanthocyanins
Soybean seeds were ground and sieved through a 55 mesh screen. 40 mg of seed powder was
mixed with 70% aqueous ethanol (4mL, 1% HCI) containing 1.5 ug/ml phlorizin as an internal
standard, sonicated for 30-min, and set at room temperature in the dark for 16hours. 2 mL
supernatant was filtered through a 0.20-um syringe filter with the GH Polypro membrane (Pall
Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), freeze-dried under the vacuum, and re-dissolved using
0.5 mL of 50% aqueous ethanol for the LC/MS analysis.
Anthocyanins were quantified using the MicrOTOF-Q II (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Ger-
many) mass spectrometer coupled with the 1290 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA, USA). Resolving power ofthe MS instrument was 17500 at m/z 922. The composi-
tions of solvent system were as follows; solvent A- water/acetonitrile (95:5, v/v with 0.1% for-
mic acid), solvent B-acetonitrile/water (95:5, v/v with 0.1% formic acid). A 45-min linear
gradient was applied; initially 10 to 60% increment of solvent B for 35 min, followed by a
steeper increment of60to 100% solvent B for 10 min. Chromatographic separation was per-
formed using reverse phase Aegispak C18 Column (250x4.6mm, 5-um) at flow rate of0.7 ml/
min.10-uL aliquot of each extract was injected into the mass spectrometer, and spectra were
monitored ranging from 150-1000 m/z with 1.0 sec interval under the positive ESI mode. The
ion source parameters for high-resolution mass measurements were as follows; +4.5kV for the
capillary voltage, 10 L/min ofthe nebulization gas flow, 180°Cas a source gas temperature and
35 V for the cone voltage. A calibration curve for each anthocyanin was plottedby calculating,
based on the weighted least squares regression analysis, the ratio of peak areas between ana-
lyte/internal standard and the nominal concentration of analyte in 50% blank ethanol.
Results
Genetic and phenotypic diversity of 438 Glycine accessions
Originally, we acquired WGR data from a total of £783 Glycine accessions (662 plus 121 acces-
sions from ENA and NABIC, respectively) available on the public databases(DB). Additionally,
WGR data for 43 soybean accessions were newly generated in this study (NCBI SRAaccession
ID; SRR767070-SRR7637112) and combined with the public data, thereby accounting for a
total of 826 WGR data sets. Ofthese, 739 accessions (89.5%) were correctly mapped to the soy-
bean reference genome (Williams 82 assembly v2.0), while phenotype information couldbe
obtained only for 438 accessions (59.3%) via public DBs and literatures (S1 Table). According
to geographical origins, the reorganized WGR data consisted of 169 Korean accessions, 137
Chinese accessions, and 132 accessions from other countries (Fig 1A). Resulting 6.7 Tb

sequence data, with an average depth of 15.7 x for each genome, were analyzed using the
GATK standard protocol. This analysis allowed us to identify a total of5717575 SNPs and
961113 InDels (S2 Table).
The phylogenetic topology of fneighbor-joining tree demonstrated that 438 Glycine acces-
sions (G. max, 381 accessions; G.soja, 57 accessions) couldbe groupedinto three main clades,
which were mainly correlated with their evolutionary relationships rather than geographical
locations (Fig 1B). Consistent with this phylogenetic investigation, the fastSTRUCTURE anal-
ysis also resulted in an estimated value ofK == 3 as the optimal number ofs subpopulations (S1
Fig). Within the whole context of phylogeny, the majority ofwild soybeans (i.e., G. soja, 96.5%
[55/57]) were clustered linto Group-1, almost all of whichhad black seed coat with tawny
pubescence. Group-2 was mainly composed oflandraces with various seed coat colors, while
the majority ofthem had black seed coat. Different from other groups, Group-3 consisted of
cultivars and landraces with various seed colors, while the majority ofthose exhibited the yel-
low seed coat. It was notable that the frequency ofblack seed color decreased gradually from
Group-1 to Group-3, whereas the occurrence of yellow seeds increased in an opposite manner.
It was also observed that yellow hilum and gray pubescence were increasingly selected during
the development ofsoybean cultivars from the wild species. Taken together, both population
structure and phylogenetic investigation indicate that seed pigmentation-associated trait was
appreciably influencedby selection on seed colors during the history of domestication pro-
cesses in soybean cultivars (Fig 1, S3 Table).
Reference-based GWAS analysis on soybean pigmentation-associated traits
For the purposes ofin-depth identification and cross-confirmation of causative variants asso-
ciated with soybean seed pigmentation, two different sets of data were employed for the
GWAS analysis. Both data sets contained 6678688 variants (>6.6M SNP data) from 438 WGR
data and 36587 variants (>36K SNP data) for the SoySNP50K array data derived from 20087
soybean accessions, respectively. Each data set showed different frequencies and distributions
ofnucleotide variations throughout the genome. SNPs of 438 WGR data were distributedrela-
tively more randomly or evenly, with an average frequency ofSNP/158bp, compared to that of
the SoySNP50K array data (S2 Fig). In contrast, it was shown that SNP distribution ofthe
SoySNP50K array chip corresponded mainly on gene-rich genomic regions, presumably due

to intentional variant selection around proximal regions of genes (S2 Fig). For precise predic-
tion oftrait-associated genomic loci through GWAS statistical analysis, reasonably large num-
bers of samples and variants are essential. Thus, we intended to complement GWAS analysis
with one another by employing two different variant call data sets (i.e., 438 WGR data with
higher numberofSNPs and SoySNP50K array chip data with highernumber of soybean acces-
sions). Towards this direction, statistically significant signals were filtered land cross-checked
using both data sets, and shared portions ofGWAS analyses were extracted to cross-check the
results. In order for qualitative traits like seed pigmentation to be analyzedbased on the linear
mixed model (LMM), quantified binomial terms, such as 'case' or 'control', for the qualitative
traits are required. However, LMM-based GWAS analysis is not suitable for simultaneously
dissecting qualitative traits representedby three or more phenotypes. To dissolve such alimit,
we created all possible combinations that could be distinguishedby the 'case/control' binomial
quantitative characters for three contrasting phenotypes (i.e., colors for the seed coat, hilum,
and pubescence), and performed the GWAS analyses for each combination with correspond-
ing data (Fig 2, S3Fig). As a result, four seed pigmentation (SP)-associatedloci (designated as
SP1-SP4 in this study) were identifiedin four chromosomes (i.e., chromosomes 1,6, 8 and 9).
In addition, genomicloci for three other qualitative traits, including pod color, flower color,
and growth habit, were identified (S4 Fig).
Detailed information on seed color-associated GWAS results is summarized in Table 1 and
S4 Table. Ofthese four loci, SP2 locus was revealed to be involved in the pubescence color and
to span a genomic range of 17683675-19248187bp in Chromosome 6 (Table 1). Within this

region, the most statistically significant variant, which could affect the function ofthe protein
product, was found at 18737366 bp. This nucleotide alteration resulted in a frameshift caused
by a single base deletion (i.e., TC-T) on F3'H gene, which was previously known as Tlocus
(Table 1). Consistent with the previous report, the single base deletion altered its reading
frame and introduced a premature termination, consequently resulting in a truncated F3'H
protein in which lost GGEK consensus sequence and heme-binding domain essential for its
function [7]. Occurrences ofthetruncated protein products were different depending on their
pubescence colors; 1.55% (4/258) and 84.62% (143/169) among soybeans with tawny and gray
pubescence, respectively (S4B Table). In addition, a new deletion variant (i.e., CA-Cat
Chr6_18737556 bp) was discovered in the same gene, which was positioned at 190 bp
upstream of above-mentioned variant allele (S4B Table). This allele was also predictedto pro-
duce a cleaved F3'H protein. Overall frequencies ofloss-of-function causedby these two trun-
cated variants were 1.55% (6/258) and 88.76 (150/169) depending on tawny and gray
pubescence colors, respectively (S4B Table).
GWAS analyses identified dthe SP4locus near the terminal region ofchromosome 9 and
revealed that the locus was associated with brown pigmentation in both seed coat and hilum
(Fig 2). Among many variant alleles found within this locus, a nucleotide variation with the
highest probability and functional impact on protein synthesis was identified at 45759137bp
(Table 1, S4D Table). Further analysis could predict that the variant allele (a single base dele-
tion ofTC-T, and subsequent introduction of premature stop codon) would produce a trun-
cated transcript of R2R3 MYB TF (Glyma.09G235100) (Table 1, S4D Table). Itis known that
the R2R3 MYB TF is a key member of previously reported Tlocus and regulates expression of
UF3GT gene, which plays a critical role in the final step ofanthocyanin biosynthesis [10]. It
was also previously reported that UF3GT expression was repressed when the R2R3 MYB TF
was alteredby four different variants [10]. Consistent with Gillman' 's data (10), we could detect
the same three of ffour variants within the genic region ofR2R3 MYB TF as follows: G-C at
Chr9_45758856 bp, nonsynonymous mutation; CG-C at Chr9_45759100 bp, frameshift;
GT-TT at Chr9_45759165, loss of splicing donor site (S4D Table). Consistent with this analy-
sis, 98.2% (159/162) soybean accessions with normal R2R3 MYB TF exhibited black seed
coats, while 100% (28/28) soybean accessions with altered genotypes resulted in brown ones.
With regard to hilum phenotypes, soybean accessions also exhibited different frequencies of
hilum colors; 91.90% (193/210) ofblack hilum and 98.61% (71/72) ofbrown ones without or
with altered alleles in R2R3 MYB TF, respectively (S4D Table).

Dissecting seed pigmentation-associated loci iand genes in the soybean
GWAS analysis with a reorganized population of yellow VS green seed coats allowed us to
identify the SP1 locus at the terminal region of chromosome 1, which was potentially associ-
atedwith the phenotype of green seed coat (Fig 2, S5A Fig). Identification of SP1 locus was
cross-confirmed using the SoySNP50K array chip (S5A Fig). It was acquainted that SP1 locus
corresponded to qSC1 locus that was one of14 qSC loci previously mapped by QTL analysis
using abi-parental population [6]. It was known that dominant qSC1 allele was involved in the
phenotype of green seed coat, whereas recessive qscl allele resulted in yellow ones. However,
causative genic components have yet not been articulated probably due to a vast range ofthe
qSC1 genomic region (1079 Kbp) and relatively low statistical significance [6]. Nevertheless,
we could considerably narrow down corresponding genomic region for the qSC1 locus (182
Kbp) and identified six functionally significant candidate genes within this region (S4A Table,
S5 Table). Among many other variants and 16 candidate genes, it was expected that a nucleotide
alteration found at the RNA splicing site (i.e., AG-AA at Chr1_53229579 bp) ofGly-
ma.01G198500 (annotated as CaaX-type endopeptidase or CaaXEP) should be the most func-
tionally significant (S5 Table). To verify production of falternatively spliced transcript, RNA-
seq data was collected from the public domains and mapped on the CaaXEP gene using String-
Tie program (htps/ccbjhu.edulsoftware/stringtiel) [43]. This transcriptome analysis allowed
us to reveal that the alternative splicing site was generated 168 bp behind the original location
and led to the creation of a new protein product exhibiting a different open reading frame and
3D-structure (S5B and S5C Fig). In this analysis, we independently discovered and articulated
the CaaXEP gene (Glyma.01G198500) as a key player associated with the green seed coat.
However, a recent study has already reported that the same gene (ie., CaaXEP) was involved
in the phenotype ofthe green seed coat and seed dormancy as well, which was denoted as'G
locus [46]. This indicates that our study was efficient and accurate in detecting genomic loci
and characterizing key genes associated with the seed pigmentation.
In-depth GWAS analysis on i locus
For purposes ofbetter interpreting the effect ofthe Ilocus on seed pigmentation with no per-
turbation by other loci, the population was reorganized for an optimal GWAS analysis.
According to the phenotype distribution with regard to Tlocus, almost all soybean accessions
(143/144 accessions, 99.31%) possessing truncated variant(tallele) ofF3'H exhibited the color-
less phenotype (i.e., yellow or green) in seed coat, thereby allowing us to assume that the trun-
cated F3'H was intimately associated with colorlessness in seed coats (S6B Table). On the other
hand, it is known that the Ilocus involves four different alleles (namely, I,f,fandi), each of
which exerts different effects on colors of seed coat andhilum [7,11]. Taken combined genetic
properties together between these two loci, the population was sub-divided according to their
phenotypes (i.e., seed coat, hilum, and pubescence) (S6 Fig), with an expectation that GWAS
analysis with the re-organizedpopulation according to customized genotypic combinations
couldlead us to more accurate investigation on the i allele. Towards this direction, popula-
tions with the following phenotypic contrasts were used for rbGWAS analysis; 'colored seed
coat/colored hilum/brown pubescence' vs 'colorless seed coat/colored hilum/brown pubes-
cence'. This customized-by-case rbGWASled us to the identification ofthe SP3locus(conven-
tionally Ilocus), which was mapped to 8360-8622 Kbp region ofchromosome 8 (Fig 1,
Table 1), and revealed that the corresponding genomic region was clustered with multiple cop-
ies ofCHS genes. As widely known, CHS catalyzes the initial step ofthe phenylpropanoid
pathwayleading to the flavonoid biosynthesis and plays a pivotal role in regulating spatial/tem-
poral production of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins [7,11].It was previously reported
that the expression ofCHS gene in soybeans with colorless seed coat was hampered by the

posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), consequently leading to the abolishment of chal-
cone production, which was the first stage precursor towards the synthesis offlavonoids and
other secondary metabolites [13]. Among alleles found in this genomic region, a variant allele
with the highest functional impact was detected in CHS4 (G-A at Chr8_8507079; Gly-
ma.08G110500) (Table 1). However, this nucleotide variation could not account for the
expected mechanism ofthe PTGS. Most perplexingly, a large unsequenced genomic segment,
probably due to confounded read assembly by inverted repeat arrangement of fmultiple CHS
genes, was noticed and hampered further analysis into searching for key trait-associated ele-
ments within the locus.
Discovering a genomic structural change at Ilocus by k-mer analysis
Since rbGWAS could not further dissect detailed genomic structure ofthe i locus due to
incomplete assembly around corresponding genomic region, k-mer-based variant calling
method, which could effectively operate in reference-independent manner, was applied to
scrutinize the genomic structures and to identify variations. As a prelude to verify reliability of
variant data obtained from the k-mer-based analysis, all k-mers with optimal length consisting
of31 nucleotides were compared with variants derived from the reference-based variant call-
ing method. The data comparison exhibited la reliable consistency between two different, but
complementary, analytical methods (ie., reference-based VS reference-free variant calling
methods); for examples, SP1-99.54%, SP2-97.92% and SP4-96.58% (S6 Table).
To search for the missing genomic part off locus, association analysis was performed using
only variant data set, which was obtained from the k-mer-based variant calling. Ofallk-mers,
a unique k-mer with the consensus sequence of'ATGTCAATAAGATAAGTATAT TGTA
AAATGG' (namedk-mer) showed significantly different distribution between two above
mentioned populations; 1.3% (2/154 accessions) in the population with phenotypes of'colored
seed coaticoloredhilum/brown pubescence VS 95.5% (64/67 accessions) in the population
consisting of 'colored seed coat/colorless hilum/brown pubescence'. To locate corresponding
genomic position ofthe k-mer', BLAST was carried out against two reference genomes; G.
max Williams 82 Chntpel/phytozomejgidoegwipuiperalhmitinffoAalias-Org.Gmay and
G. soja PI483463 (https/isoybase.org/data/public/Glycinc.soja/P1483463.gnml.Y/WS), How-
ever, the genomic position ofk-mer' could not be found in neither G. max nor G. soja
genomes, implicating that one oftwo genomes was incompletely assembled around the k-mer'
site. Subsequently, BLAST was conducted against the non-redundant nucleotide database, in
which contained the largest collection of fnucleotide sequences. Such an attempt allowed us to
find two G. max bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones (i.e., BAC77G7-a and
Gm_ISb001_104.J07).
It was found that BAC77G7-a clone was previously sequenced and analyzed to study the
effects ofCHS genes at Ilocus on the seed pigmentation [12]. Corresponding study found two
invertedrepeat clusters (namely, I-clusters A & B), each ofwhich was arranged in the order of
CHS1-CHS3-CHS4 VS CHS4-CHS3-CHS1, respectively. It was revealed that the k-mer' newly
identified in this study was localized on the right side ofl-cluster B, which was the missing
genomic part in the reference genome and thereby could not be properly analyzedby the
rbGWAS approach (Fig 3A). In an attempt to find a causal genomic change, it was also
revealed, by comparing I-cluster ofBAC77G7-a with correspondinggenomic region ofG. soja
(PI483463), that a critical recombination event had occurred at thellocus in G. soja genome,
leading to the creation ofa new recombinant allele, subsequent inheritance into G. max
genome (Fig 3A) and thereafter selection for soybean cultivars with yellow seed coats. Coinci-
dently, such a scenario ofthe new allele creation could be evidenced by the k-mer' that

positioned precisely onto the recombination genomic site (Fig 3A). Also, Cho et al (2019) con-
firmed that a recombination event occurred at the same location [47].
Identifying a chimeric subilisin-CHSI/CHS3 gene
It was noteworthy that the 5-portion oftruncated subtilisin gene was connectednext to the I-
cluster B due to the recombination event (Fig 3A). This resulted lin a truncated subtilisin with a
loss of3-portion ofthe gene, while retaining its 5-portion and its own cis-elements, which
might control the expression ofrearranged chimeric gene. To verify a creation ofthe unex-
pected chimeric transcript, mRNA sequence data (SRR1174225; generated from the seed coat
ofG. max Williams 82) were obtained and mapped onto the BAC77G7-a BAC clone sequence.
As a result, RNA-seq reads were mapped not only to the coding regions oftruncated subtilisin
but also, interestingly, to an unexpected genomic region located between CHS3 and CHS4,
which was predicted to be a newly acquired exon (Fig 3B). In addition, we could identify a sig-
nificant number ofj junction reads spanning the fourth exon ofthe truncated subtilisin and the
newly found fifth exon positioned between CHS3 and CHS4 (Fig 3B). This result clearly

Dissecting seed pigmentation-associated loci iand genes in the soybean
demonstrates the creation ofa new transcript reading frame, within which two CHS genes
occupies the middle portion of fnewly acquired intron ofthe chimeric gene along with the gain
ofa new terminal exon (Fig 3B). Consequently, the RNA-seq mapping analysis provided a
strong evidence that the recombination occurred at the Ilocus had eventually led to the crea-
tion ofa new chimeric transcript enclosing both CHS1 and CHS3 genes (named as chimeric
subilisin-CHSI/CHS3 or SC1C3 gene). In addition, the sequence similarity between CHS1
and CHS3 including their introns is really high (>99%), and subsequently two very similar
sequences, when aligned in an inverted orientation, can allow formation ofa hairpin structure
that may potentially cause the RNA interference [48].
Discovering intron-containing primary miRNA via mirtron
To confirm whether the chimeric SCIC3 gene is a key player responsible for the PTGS mecha-
nism ofCHS genes, NGS-derived small RNAS were further analyzed. Towards this direction,
small RNA sequence data (SRR646505; generated from the seed coat ofG. max Williams 82)
were obtained and mapped onto both soybean reference genome and BAC77G7-a. As shown
in Fig 4, the analysis focused on the distribution patterns across CHS genes, in which the
majority ofsmall RNAS were mapped along on the exon regions ofCHS genes with high fre-
quencies. In this analysis, it was most notable that a considerable portion of fsmall RNA reads
were mapped on the intron regions of CHS1 and CHS3, but not on introns of CHS4 and any
other CHS genes (Fig 4, S7 Fig). This result strongly indicates that only two CHS genes (ie.,
CHS1 and CHS3), which changed into a new intron ofthe chimeric SCIC3 gene, can play a
certain role in the small RNA biogenesis via 'mirtron (i.e., intron-containing miRNA precur-
sor)' formation. Naturally due to high sequence similarity and inverted orientation between
CHS1 and CHS3, this finding allowed us to conceive a subsequent generation of mirtron-
derived primary microRNAs (miRNAs) after the splicing of pre-mRNA derived from the chi-
meric SCIC3 gene.

Dissecting seed pigmentation-associated loci iand genes in the soybean
In addition, it was expected that the primary miRNAs might stimulate the amplification of
small RNA species in cells by inducing secondary small interfering RNAS (siRNAS) derived
from mRNAS ofall other CHS genes. As a supportive example, CHS-wide small RNA mapping
analysis provides evidence that CHS7 transcript (also including other CHS genes) can be
silenced by the mirtron-mediated secondary siRNAs. In more detail, CHS7 (chromosome 1) is
totally separated from the i allele (chromosome 8) and has quite low sequence similarity with
CHS1, where the sequence alignment tof>20 bp long small RNAS exhibited only 7.43% (120/
1615 bp ofCHS7) ofperfect matches between CHS1 and CHS7. Nevertheless, it was shown
that a large portion ofthe small RNA reads was mapped to CHS7 (and/or CHS8 that has high
sequence similarity to CHS7), but with no small RNAS mapped within its intron region (Fig
4B, S7 Fig). This result indicates that the small RNAS identified within CHS7 are all generated
through miRNA-directed mRNA cleavage of mature CHS mRNAS, which is known as phased
small interfering RNA' (phasiRNA) [49]. Cho et al (2013) suggested that secondary CHS siR-
NAs from the CHS7 target mRNA was amplified by primary CHS siRNAs which was gener-
ated from the inverted repeat cluster of chalcone synthase genes CHS1-3-4 [50]. However, our
results show that secondary siRNA is amplified by primary CHS miRNA, not primary CHS
siRNA.
Discussion
Since the advent ofhigh-throughput NGS sequencing technologies and large scale genotyping
array platforms, GWAS has played a pivotal role in identifying informative trait-associated
genes and genomic loci in many crops [6,18,51-54]. On the other side, many programs rele-
vant to GWAS analysis, such as PLINK, EMMAX, GAPIT and MLMM, have been developed
towards extracting more accurate genomic information within the context of phenotype-to-
genotype correlations [37,41,55,56]. Nevertheless, the rbGWAS analyses can commonly be
affected by the accuracy and completeness ofreference genomes. In addition, the rbGWAS
may sometimes mislead us to erroneous conclusions, ifthe reference genomes are misassem-
bled due to their complex nature. Moreover, even if fa certain genome is perfectly assembled as
a standardframework for the reference, rbGWAS may retain their innate limitations against
calling every single variation, mainly due to the genome's complexity and large scale genomic
changes unaccounted in common GWAS analyses (e.g., copy number variations [or CNV],
inversions and translocations), all of which may cause the 'missing heritability' problem [21].
Therefore, it seems reliable that the k-mer-based rfGWAS may offer a new avenue or a means
that can effectively complement the rbGWAS. The k-mer-based approach may exert undeni-
able advantages over common rbGWAS analyses by enabling us to discover any types ofvari-
ants, including large scale structural variations and CNVs as well as common SNPs and
InDels, regardless ofthe integrity ofreference genomes. To our best knowledge, this study
would be one of rare cases in which the k-mer-based association analysis was applied to dis-
cover trait-associated genomic variations in plants. By employing dual analytical approaches
and phenotype-defined populations, four genomic loci (i.e., SP1-SP4loci) associated with the
seed colors could be identified (Fig 2, S3 Fig). Ofthese four loci, it was proved that three loci
(i.e., SP1, SP2 and SP4) corresponded to the previously reported genomic loci(i.e., qSC1/G, T
and R loci, respectively) (Table 1) [7,10,46]. Further in-depth analysis proved that the corre-
sponding variant alleles were identified in key trait-associated genes at each locus.
To get a more integrated picture ofcorrelations and/or interactions among these genes and
loci, a biochemical characterization was performed by measuring the contents of anthocyanins
in 43 soybean accessions that were used for the WGR data production (S7 Table). Interactions

to-phenotype correlations are depicted in Fig 5. As shown in S7 Table, it is obvious that the
colored phenotype of seeds (i.e., black seed coat/hilum and brown pod/pubescence) is exhib-
ited when all these anthocyanins are synthesized, except for delphinidin-derived anthocyanins
(e.g., delphinidin 3-0-gloucoside and petunidin 3-0-glucoside). The W1 locus, in which the
F3'5'H gene plays a key role, governs the production of delphinidin-derived anthocyanins and
may affect colors of seeds and flowers. Thus, even ifthree other loci (i.e., I, Tand R) located in
the upstream ofthe metabolic pathway are all functionally active, the wl allele would prohibit
the production of delphinidin-derived pigments, as represented in the phenotype ofwhite
flowers under the genetic background of HiRRTTwlwl allele combination (Fig 5). The Tlocus,
which harbors the F3'H gene as the key enzyme, plays its role at the nodal position within the
anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, at which it can control the production ofcyanidin-derived
anthocyanins as well as delphinidin-derived ones (Fig 5). Consistentwith this pathway-based
depiction, 99.3% (146/147) soybeans with t allele exhibited yellow seed coats (S6B Table).In
addition, the R locus (represented by R2R3 MYB TF) plays a key regulatory role before and
after the synthesis ofanthocyanidins (e.g., cyanidin and delphinidin) by modulating the
expression ofANS and UF3GT. Finally, the Ilocus (represented by CHS gene clusters) occu-
pies the verytop hierarchy ofthe flavonoid pathway, and thus plays the key role as a master
switch that can control overall anthocyanin biosynthesis. Therefore, if genes and/or alleles of
high status within the biosynthetic pathway are in inactive forms (e.g., if or tt alleles), such
genetic background will cause colorless phenotypes in seeds (Fig 5). However, since the

phenotypes relevant to these multiple loci can be further confounded by other homologous
genes residing in different genomic loci, integrative genetic dissection and in-depth interpreta-
tion should be made with a great caution.
As mentioned in the results section, rbGWAS could not capture the full content of associa-
tion signals at the Ilocus due to incomplete assembly ofthe reference genome (Fig 2C).Itwas
obvious that the defective structure ofthe current reference genome was caused by duplicated
clusters ofCHS genes around the Ilocus, but its structural arrangement ofinverted repeats
was demonstrated by previous analyses in soybean [12,57] and G. soja [58]. In both genomes,
they share the same inversely repeated array composed of two I-clusters (i.e.,I-cluster A;
CHS1-3-4 and I-cluster B; CHS4-3-1) on the chromosome 8 [59]. As itis well known, CHS is
one ofthe most important master switches that regulate the biosynthetic pathways for the
anthocyanin production with the highest hierarchy (Fig 5). Thus, many endeavors have been
made to get an insight into how the CHS cluster-containing gi allele exerts its effect on seed col-
ors via gene silencing. Both Tuteja et al (2009) and Xie et al (2019) had proposed their own
working models for CHS gene silencing occurring at the i allele, but in different ways. Thus, it
was interpreted with our extreme caution that both models did not seem fully explainable.
Tuteja et al (2009) appeared to miss a fact that chimeric subilisin-CHSI/CHS3 transcript was
created and acted as a trigger for the PTGS. In contrast, Xie et al (2019) recognized the pres-
ence ofthe chimeric gene by comparing G. soja and G. max genomes. Nevertheless, it was sus-
pected that they could not precisely define a new open reading frame for the chimeric
transcript, by which could serve as an initiator for the inverted repeat-mediated PTGS.
By employing the k-mer analysis, this study independently revealed the recombination
event occurred between subtilisin and I-cluster B and resulting structural change that had
been inherited and adapted into the currently cultivated soybean genomes carrying the pheno-
type of fyellow seed coat (Fig 3A). One step further, mapping analysis of mRNA-seq data
allowed us to identify the chimeric SC1C3 transcript in the seed coat, whose pre-mRNA con-
tained CHS1 and CHS3 within its newly acquired intron (Fig 3B). Subsequently, small RNA
mapping analysis against CHS genes revealed the generation ofmiRNAs from the intron com-
posed of CHS1 and CHS3, but not from introns of CHS4 and other CHS genes (Fig 4, S7 Fig),
and hence providing a significant evidence for the mirtron production. Such a special type of
miRNA precursor (i.e., mirtron) has recently been found and reported in many species, such
as Drosophila, C. elegans, Human, Arabidopsis and Rice [48,60-62]. Taken together with these
two new findings and the special structural feature ofthe i allele, we are carefully proposing a
new PTGS working model via 'mirtron-triggered CHS gene silencing (MTGS) mechanism,
which would be occurring in the yellow seed soybeans (Fig 6). As demonstrated in Fig 6, the
chimeric SCIC3 gene generates its pre-mRNA containing a new transcript frame under the
control of subtilisin promoter, thereafter producing a lariat form of post-splicing introns, one
ofwhich harbors CHS1 and CHS3 arranged in an inverted orientation. After the lariat-form
intron is linearized by a debranching enzyme (i.e., debranchase), the CHSI/CHS3-containing
intron will fold into semfop.comtiningpreunons (tailed pre-miRNA) due to its innate
structural feature ofinverted tandem duplication. Subsequently, 3' and 5' overhangs of tailed
pre-miRNAs are removed by RNA exosome and nucleases, respectively [60,63-66], finally
generating hairpin-formed intron-containing miRNA precursors (i.e., mirtron) [48]. Accord-
ing to known general PTGS process in plants, the double-stranded stem portion ofmirtron is
digested into shortmiRNA by Dicer-like protein (DCL), which occurs in the nucleus [67]. Fur-
thermore, based on CHS-wide small RNA mapping analysis (S7 Fig), it is strongly assumed
that the primary miRNAs can serve as primers for the induction and production ofphased,
secondary, small interfering RNAS (i.e., phasiRNAs), which were originally designated as
trans-acting small RNAS (tasiRNAs) and known as an efficient mechanism for synchronously

controlling a large number of genes with some extents ofhomology (e.g., family genes such as
MYB and NBS-LRR) [49,68]. Similar to this mechanism, phasiRNA (or secondary siRNA)
derived from other CHS genes can be generated in such a way that the single-stranded primary
miRNA act as primers for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR), and subsequently
resulting double-stranded RNA precursors are diced by the DCL proteins, finally producing
the secondary SiRNA (i.e., phasiRNA) (Fig6).
In this way, it appears that the pool of small RNA species (i.e., primary miRNA plus second-
ary phasiRNA) can be enormously amplified through these two separate, but actually interact-
ing, transcription regulatory circuits (Fig6), until the cell is equipped with nearly the entire
breadth ofCHS gene-wide sequence specificity, which was evidenced by the small RNA map-
ping analyses (S7 Fig). A possible scenario is that such a pool of small RNAS with full extent of
CHS-wide specificity may be able to degrade almost all of CHS transcripts expressed from all
genome-wide sectors for the CHS genes, ultimately leading to the phenotype (i.e., colorless-
ness) caused by complete knock-down ofCHS genes. Consistent with this scenario, we could
not detect any anthocyanins in yellow soybeans (Fig 5, S7 Table). In this working model, itis

noteworthy that the mirtron plays a critical role as a 'trigger' for the PTGS-mediated regulatory
circuit (Fig 6).
Conclusions
To precisely identify and dissect genes and genomic loci associated with the pigmentation of
soybean seeds, this study employed an integrated approach in both analytical means (i.e.,
rbGWAS and rfGWAS) and data resources (i.e., in-house-generated and public WGR data).
These analyses resulted in the detection of ffour major genomic loci (designated as SP1 2 SP4),
key genes and numerous functional variants across the soybean whole genome. Ofthese four
loci, in-depth dissection of SP3locus (conventionally known as Ilocus), in which contained a
special genomic arrangement of CHS gene clusters, led us to a meaningful finding. The k-mer
analysis allowed us to discover an ancient recombination event between subtilisin and I-cluster
B, leading to the revelation of special structural features in the i allele ofllocus. Mapping anal-
yses with NGS-derived mRNA-seq and small RNA data enabled us to discover chimeric subtil-
isin-CHS1/CHS3 transcripts followed by 'mirtron' generation. Based on these results, it
implicates that the mirtron plays a pivotal role as an initiator towards the direction of amplify-
ing CHS-derived secondary siRNAS or phasiRNA, thereafterleading to the complete silencing
ofgenome-wide CHS genes. Consequently, we carefully suggest a new working modelof'mir-
tron-triggered gene silencing' (or MTGS) mechanism, even ifit needs to be further investi-
gated through future experimental endeavor. Itis anticipated that the MTGS model will offer a
deeper and broader insight into the PTGS pathways interacting within the context of complex
regulatory circuits. We also expect that the information on trait-associated alleles found in this
study will be beneficially used for the precision breeding ofthe crop soybean.
