Abstract: A worldwide food shortage has been projected as a result of the current increase in global
population and climate change. In order to provide sufficient food to feed more people, we must
develop crops that can produce higher yields. Plant early vigor traits, early growth rate (EGR), early
plant height (EPH), inter-node length, and node count are important traits that are related to crop
yield. Glycine soja, the wild counterpart to cultivated soybean, Glycine max, harbors much higher
genetic diversity and can grow in diverse environments. It can also cross easily with cultivated
soybean. Thus, it holds a great potential in developing soybean cultivars with beneficial agronomic
traits. In this study, we used 225 wild soybean accessions originally from diverse environments
across its geographic distribution in East Asia. We quantified the natural variation of several early
vigor traits, investigated the relationships among them, and dissected the genetic basis of these
traits by applying a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) with genome-wide single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) data. Our results showed positive correlation between all early vigor traits
studied. A total of 12 SNPS significantly associated with EPH were identified with 4 shared with
EGR. We also identified two candidate genes, Glyma.07G055800.1 and Glyma.07G055900.1, playing
important roles in influencing trait variation in both EGR and EPH in G. soja.

1. Introduction
The cultivated soybean, Glycine max, is an important legume crop that supplies the majority of
protein meal and oilseed worldwide [1]. Crop improvement is a continuous necessity as the demands
in agriculture increase due to a changing environment and rising population. Modern soybean
crops are challenged by abiotic and biotic stress. In order for soybean production to keep up with
the growing population, novel modifications must be made to the current crop beyond modern
breeding practices [2]. The wild counterpart to the cultivated soybean, Glycine soja, is analyzed for
genetic associations to early vigor traits that are not present in the cultivated population.
G. max diverged from G. soja 0.27 [3] or 0.8 million years ago (mya) [4], leaving much of the wild
genetic variability behind [5]. The cultivated soybean further diverged as a result of domestication
in China 6000-9000 years ago; however, the wild soybean continues to inhabit a wide range of
areas across Eastern Asia [3,6]. The gene pool in wild soybean retains the genes and alleles lost
during the process of artificial breeding practices and, more importantly, the initial domestication
of the soybean, which contributes to 16.2% and 31% reduction in genetic diversity, respectively [7].
Selection and improvement within G. max have been shown to have a significant effect on diversity on

all twenty chromosomes [8,9]. By exploiting the genetic diversity harbored in the wild soybean, we are
able to discover novel sources of agronomical superiority.
Early vigor is a combination of traits that impact the eventual success and yield of a plant.
The early vigor phenotypic traits studied in G. soja are node count, inter-node length, early growth rate,
and early plant height. Early growth rate (EGR) and early plant height (EPH) are further analyzed
for genotypic dissection using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These traits have not been
studied or used for genetic association in wild soybean thus far. The node count and inter-node
length are representative of the density of plant foliage, as each node results in a branching compound
leaf. There is a significant correlation between the yield per soybean plant and branch number [10].
Measurements of mature plant height in wild soybeans are relatively challenging due to its fragile
stem and vining nature. Therefore, EPH can be used as an analysis of height while the plant is still in
early growth stages. EGR is an important complex trait, and often associated with the ultimate success
of the plant. Seed vigor is determined partially by an evaluation of seedling growth [11], which was
initially established in the 1950s to represent the success and productivity of the resulting plant[12].
All traits analyzed are representative of plant success and a measure of vigor.
A genome-wide associationstudy (GWAS) was usedin this study to determine genetic associations
with complex agronomically beneficial traits, EPH and EGR. GWAS has significant advantages over
the tradition approach of complex candidate loci discovery, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping.
QTL mapping relies on a crossed mapping population from only two individuals to contain all
genetic diversity for the trait being analyzed. In addition, QTL mapping is limited by its resolution
in the mapping population due to limited recombination events [13]. Although first demonstrated
for use in human disease [14], GWAShas been widely applied to plants for over a decade to identify
genes responsible for quantitative traits. While the QTL mapping approach uses just two genotypes for
genetic variation discovery, GWASutilizes an unlimited sample size and takes advantage of the genetic
and phenotypic diversity contained in the extensivenatural population and thus providing higher
mapping resolution than bi-parental populations [15,16]. The wild soybean is an ideal system for
GWAS, as it can be maintained by self-fertilization, allowing for repeated screening of genetically
similar individuals. GWAS has previously been used to dissectphenotypic traits related to biotic stress
resistance [17-19], abiotic stress tolerance [20], and seed composition [21,22] in wild soybean.
The value of crop wild relatives in crop improvement has been progressively recognized in
the past decades [23]. The wild soybean, G. soja, has been used in the genetic dissection of soybean
growth/24,25), yield [26], seed composition [21,27], abiotic stress tolerance [20,28-32], and biotic stress
resistance [18,33-42]. However, to our knowledge, using G. soja to study early vigor phenotypic
traits, such as early growth rate, early plant height, node count, and inter-node length, has never
been reported. To explore the genetic diversity harbored in the wild soybean, we used GWAS to
effectively characterize the genetic architecture of early vigor traits. This study aims to make use of
a cutting-edge quantitative trait loci discovery method to dissect the genetic basis of agronomically
beneficial traits, EGR and EPH, and their relationships to inter-node length and node count to further
crop-improvement techniques.
2. Results
2.1. Correlation in Phenotypic Traits
All trait relationships studied on 225 ecotypes ofG. soja, inter-nodelengthtonodecount, inter-node
length to EGR, inter-node length to EPH, node count to EPH, node count to EGR, and EGR to EPH,
expressed significant positive correlations, p < 0.001, by Spearman's correlation test (Table 1). As
a trend, plants with higher growth rate and height had more nodes and the distance between each of
the nodes was greater.

2.2. Genome-Wide Association Analysis
A total of 31,726 filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS) was used for the principle
component analysis (PCA) and GWAS. The PCA result was shown in Figure 1C. The Mixed Linear
Model (MLM) combined with kinshipand structure control resulted in four significant SNPS associated
with EGR and 12 significant SNPS associated with EPH, with chromosome-wide false discovery rate
(FDR)-adjusted p < 0.05 (Table 2). All significant SNPS associated with EGR are also significant for
EPH. The most highly associated SNP to EGR and EPH, ss715598271, is significant (p < 0.05) by
all p-value adjustment and threshold tests (chromosome-wide Bonferroni, genome-wide Bonferroni,
and genome-wide FDR). SNP marker ss715598271 explains 10.85% of EGR phenotype variation and
12.42% of EPH phenotype variation. Bracketing markers to Ss715598271, ss715598270, and ss715598272
are also shown to be significant by chromosome-wide Bonferroni threshold adjustment in EPH,
explaining 8.34% and 8.17% of the phenotypic variation, respectively. Manhattan plots of EGR and
EPH (Figure 1A,B) visualize all significant SNPs by chromosome, with corresponding Q-Q plots
(Figure 1D,E). The heritability was estimated to be 0.64 for EPH and0.71 for EGR.

2.3. In-Depth Candidate Loci Investigation
The SNP ss715598271, which is significantly associated with both EGR and EPH, anditsbracketing
markers (ss715598269, ss715598270, andss715598272) associated with EPH,co-localizewith a previously
identified large QTL, plant height 19-5 [43]. In addition, these four SNPs are within 50 kb adjacent
to SNP ss715598304, an intergenic marker significantly associated with EPH, which is located under
the known QTLs: plant height 3-3 [45], plant height 25-6 [46], and plant height 19-5 [43] (Table 2).
The SNP marker ss715614175 on chromosome 13, significantly associated with both EGR and EPH,
located within the previously-described QTL related to plant height: Plant Height 26-11 [44] (Table 2).
The pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis of a 65.3-kb window containing the four
significant SNPs (ss715598269, ss715598270, ss715598271, and SS715598272) from 4,915,929 bp
to 4,928,272 bp on chromosome 7 shows high linkage within this region (Figure 2). Two
markers, ss715598269 and ss715598270, are within the intron and 3' untranslated region of gene
Glyma.07G055800.1, respectively. Two markers, ss715598271 and ss715598272, are within the intron of
gene Glyma.07G055900.1. No significant LD is found near the other significant SNPs. These, therefore,
were not investigated further for candidate genes.

(significantly associated with both EPH and EGR).
There is a significant association between ss715598271 allele polymorphism (A/C) and studied
traits EPH and EGR. The A allele morph is associated with higher EGR and higher EPH than the C
allele morph at this marker (p < 0.02) (Figure S1A,B). The significant association between allele and
trait suggests that ss715598271 might be located in a region crucial for gene functioning.

Glyma.07G055800.1 and Glyma.07G055900.1 are promising candidate genes associated with both
EPH and EGR. Glyma.07G055800.1 is predicted to encode a transmembrane protein containing DoH
and Cytochrome b-561/ferric reductase transmembrane domains [47]. Its closesthomolog inArabidopsis
is Cytochrome b561/ferric reductase transmembrane with DOMON-related domain protein (CYB561).
This protein is responsible for catalyzing transmembrane electron transfer by ascorbate, which is
a key metabolite in growth and development of plants [48]. Glyma.07G055900.1 is predicted to encode
a Tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-like super family protein, playing a role in protein binding and
translation initiation [47].
3. Discussion
Significantcorrelations were foundbetween all trnaitstudied,suggesting thatEPH, EGR,inter-node
length, and node count are all related phenotypic traits (Table 1). The positive relationship between
inter-node length and node count, inter-node length and EPH, and internode-length and EGR
demonstrates the combined effect of elongation of the inter-nodes along with the addition ofnewnodes
in early growth of the wild soybean. Each node of the wild soybean is accompaniedby one branching
compound leaf. Therefore, the observed increase in node count with EGR and EPH relates directly
to foliage increase and acquisition of available light, having a cumulative effect on growth. The total
yield has previously been shown to be positively correlated with the branching of a soybean [10].
A positive correlation between all early vigor traits tested demonstrates that the traits chosen are
reliable indicators ofearly vigor and eventual success of a plant.
We identified a total of 12 significant SNPs for EPH with 4 shared significant SNPs for EPH
and EGR. The most compelling results were found on chromosome 7, in which a contiguous set of
markers, ss715598269, ss715598270, ss715598271,and ss715598272, are highly significant, revealing
the importance of this genomic location to EGR and EPH. This locus also colocalize with a known
QTL, plant height 19-5 [43], and is adjacent to two QTLs, plant height 3-3 [45] and plant height
25-6 [46]. Although these consistently mapping QTLs were previously identified, variation in this
region might be unique to G. soja as previously described in the finding of a G. soja-unique salt-tolerant
gene GmCHX1 [49]. Further analysis showed that significantLD is evident in this region. High LD can
suggest that this genomic region might have been under positive selection in its natural environment,
which is expected as plant height is an ecologically important trait. We were able to determine an
allelic correlation with EPH and EGR at marker ss715598271. The A allele morph is correlated with
higher EGR and higher EPH than the C allele morph at this marker. This finding suggests that this
marker might be linked to genes playing important roles in influencing these trait variations in G. soja.
This is supported by significant surrounding markers and high LD in this region.
Two candidate genes, Glyma.07G055800.1 and Glyma.07G055900.1 on chromosome 7, were
identified as significantly related to EPH and EGR. Significant markers are located within the introns
of these genes and the untranslated 3' region of Glyma.07G055800.1. Glyma.07G055800.1 encodes
a Cytochrome b561 transmembrane protein, or CYB561 in Arabidopsis, a transmembrane protein
involved in electron transport [50]. Glyma.07G055900.1, encodes a Tetratricopeptide repeat-like
super family protein, homologous to Reduced Chloroplast Coverage 1 (REC1) in Arabidopsis.
The Tetratrichopeptide (TPR) domain protein has been shown to be involved in plant height-related
phenotypes in Maize and Arabidopsis [51,52] and is a known motif in plant hormone signaling
responses, such as auxin, gibberellin, and cytokinin [53,54]. It is not unlikely that multiple individuals
of this protein family share a similar influence on traits in various locations in the genome. It has been
suggested that REC1 is involved in establishing and maintaining chloroplast coverage in Arabidopsis
and could be manipulated in order to influence energy intake and yield [55]. G. soja-type REC1,
Glyma.07G055900.1, is likely involved in similar chloroplast coverage and planthormone signaling
pathways to those found in Maize and Arabidopsis, with a direct relationship to photosynthesis
efficiency and growth rate, and therefore is a promising candidate gene to further investigate for
crop improvement.

This study identified two candidate genes, Glyma.07G055800.1 and Glyma.07G055900.1, related to
early vigor traits, EGR and EPH. These traits are highly beneficial to agriculture and might have been
artificially selected for in breeding practices within cultivated soybean G. max. However, the extent of
adaptation by selection in the cultivated soybean population is limited by the small gene pool. We
explored the genetic architecture of these traits in the more diverse wild soybean G. soja to further
improve our cultivation practices beyond the limited genotype of G. max. Further investigation,
such as function validation of these candidate genes, will shed light on understanding the molecular
mechanisms of these agriculturally and ecologically important traits. Meanwhile, it will provide
a foundation for soybean trait improvement by traditional breeding, biotechnology, or genome editing.
The long-term goal is to make full use of the wild genetic resources to meet the global challenges of
agriculture sustainability and food security.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Plant Materials and Phenotyping
In total, 225 G. soja accessions obtained from the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection were
used for measurements and analysis. The original geographic distribution of these accessions includes
areas in China, Japan, Russia, and South Korea (Figure 3). All seeds were manually scarified and
germinated on filter paper for three days, after which 4-5 seedlings per genotype were transplanted
into Miracle-Gro soil in separate cells ofa3x 5 growing tray. Optimal growing conditions were kept
constant at 27 oC and 12h light/day in the greenhouse at University of North Carolina at Charlotte
(NC, USA). The plants were watered regularly to keep soil moist.

a geographic location where the samples were originally collected.
Four phenotypic traits were recorded or measured with a caliper to the nearest 0.1 mm on
each accession: node count, internode length, EGR, and EPH. EPH was measured at 20 days after
germination, and node count, EGR, and internode length were obtained as the average of three
recordings taken at days 7, 14, and 20 after germination. For each accession, measurements from two
or three seedlings, quality filtered by coefficient of variance and noted for damage during growth,
were averaged for each trait used in the analysis (Table S1).

4.2. Genotypic Data
Previously identified markers, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), for all 225 G. soja
accessions were obtained from SoyBase (http./soybase.org) [47]. All markers were originally
determined by the use of the Illumina Infinium SoySNP50K iSelect BeadChip, with 52,041 total
verified SNP markers [56]. All markers with a minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.05 or missing rate
of >10% were filtered out of the analyzed data, leaving 31,726 SNPs. All cleaned data were imputed
using BEAGLE (v 3.3.1) [57-59].
4.3. Phenotype Analysis
Pair-wise correlations among the four traits were evaluated with Spearman's analysis due to
non-normal distributions to determine the relationship between traits (specifically, the relationship
betweenheightandgrowth traits with Hhemnumhrandingpungydfndes and, therefore, relativefoliage
quantity). It has been suggested that normalization is not necessary for genome-wide association
analysis when the data size is relatively large to avoid error, such as false positives [60]. Thus,
the phenotype data was not normalized in this study. The heritability of the quantitative traits was
estimated using the following equation: (additive genetic variance)/(additive genetic variance + error
variance) [61].
4.4. Genome-Wide Association Analysis
A PCA was conducted using the GAPIT package [62]. A Mixed Linear Model (MLM) in
TASSEL [63] was performed to analyze the associations of EGR and EPH with SNPS for all 225
accessions. A principle component (PC) value of three, selected by analysis of quantile-quantile
plots at various PC values, and a scaled IBS Kinship matrix was used to control for the population
structure. Multiple significance threshold tests were used in order to substantiate the determination of
significant SNPS. The significance threshold was determined by chromosome-wide false discovery
rate (FDR) resulting in an adjusted p-value (q-value) for each marker [64]. Genome-wide FDR, along
with genome-wide and chromosome-wide Bonferroni adjustments [65,66], were also used to validate
the significant SNPs atp < 0.05 orq < 0.05 cutoff.
4.5. Investigation ofCandidate Loci
All genes within 50 kb of significant SNPs were evaluated for potential association with each
phenotype. The interval was used based on the average linkage disequilibrium reported in G. soja.
The annotated soybean reference genome, Wm82.a2.v1 (SoyBase, http:/soybase.org), was used to
determine these genes along with further investigation into the function using Phytozome [67],
TAIR[68], and BLAST2GO [69]. Known QTLs for each phenotype from SoyBase [47] in each candidate
loci were considered for validation of candidate genes. SNP allele to phenotype comparison was done
by nonparametric median tests. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) was calculated with TASSEL
and visualized with the LDheatmap R package [70].
