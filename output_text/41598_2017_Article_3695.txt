Genome-wide association (GWAS) and epistatic (GWES) studies along with expressionstudiesin
soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]were leveragedto dissectthe genetics ofSclerotinia stem rot(SSR)

multiple field and controlled environments to: (1) discover rsources ofresistance, (2) identify SNPS
associated with resistance, and (3) determine putative candidate genesto elucidate the mode of
resistance. We report 58 significant main effectloci and 24 significant epistaticinteractions associated
with SSR resistance, with candidate genesinvolvedin a wide range of processes including cell wall
structure, hormone signaling, and sugar allocation relatedto plantimmunity, revealing the complex
nature ofSSR resistance. Putative candidate genes [for example, PHYTOALEXIN DEFFICIENT4(PAD4),
ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE 3-LIKE 1(EIL3), and ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 1 (ERF1)] clustered linto

Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) [caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary] is a significant disease affecting
soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.). In addition to soybean, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is reportedto infect up to 408
different species',2. The majority ofthese species are dicotyledons, although infection on monocotyledon species
has been reported.S.sdemotiorum is predominately a necrotrophic fungus that spreads throughout the main stem
causing bleaching and shredding goftissue and severe wilting'.SSR is particularly prevalent in cool(<25Â°C) moist
environments. Since its first report in the United States in 1924, SSR has since spread across the soybean growing
regions of Northern United States and Canada.In 2009, SSR was ranked the second most damaging soybean
disease in the United States". After high temperatures and drought conditions in the Northern United States in
2012, estimatedsoybean yield suppression by SSR has gradually increased from 99.1 million kg to 947.4 million
kg in 2014 when it was ranked the fourth most damaging diseases. In addition to yield losses, SSR may impact
seed quality through oil content and reduced germination
Severity andincidence ofSSR is highly variable from year to year due to its sensitivity to weather conditions
and the aggregated nature ofS. sclerotiorum in soybean fields, making it difficult to effectively use in-season con-
trol measures such as fungicide applications". This makes the development of genetic controls desirable, and great
efforts have been made to identify sources of resistance. Since sources of complete resistancehave not been iden-
tified, sources with partial resistance are used for cultivar development in soybean breeding programs. Identified
sources include advanced cultivars, such as NK S19-90, and plant introductions' 10,11.
Bi- parentallinkage mapping has led to the discovery of many quantitative trait loci (QTL) for partial resist-
ance. A total of103 QTL on 18 ofthe 20 soybean chromosomes have been recorded on SoyBase!2 with minimal

overlap between QTL reported by different studies. Therefore, they are difficult to utilize in marker assisted
breeding.
Genome-wide association (GWAS) approaches overcome the limitations associated with linkage mapping,
such as limited allelic segregations between parents and llack ofrecombination due to population creation, while
exploiting historical recombination through high-resolution mapping. GWAS is broadly utilized in soybean in
order to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits13-16. GWAS studies have been performed for several
biotic stresses including S. sclerotiorum'-t9. However, these studies were donein contrlledenvironments which
has been shown to result in poor or inconsistent correlations with field evaluations"1, 20,21. Therefore, there is a
need for GWAS developed in field and greenhouse environments that complement each other by considering
naturalhostresponses: and disease conditions. This will lenhance the understanding ofresistance mechanisms and
advancebreeding efforts tobetter accommodate farmer needs.
GWAS has been used to identify many genetic variants associated with diseases; however, these only explain a
portion ofthe heritability of complex traits A recent study in soybean explored both the additive and epistatic
effects associated with sudden death syndrome (SDS) resistance?3. This was done through both GWAS and
genome-wide epistasis studies (GWES), and interactions identified were able to explain additional phenotypic
variation. Although GWES has been usedin human disease research, it has not been widely usedin plants. Since
previous studies focused on the additive effects that result from GWAS, information on epistatic interactions
could lincrease the understanding behind the complex genetic architecture of quantitative traits, including the
mode ofresistance, and better assist breeders in identifying favorable allelic combinations.
The main objectives of this study were to discover new sources ofSSR resistance in soybean, identify markers
associated with SSR resistance for both additive and epistatic effects, and determine putative candidate genes
that control SSR resistance to elucidate the main mode of resistance. In order to achieve this, soybean acces-
sions were evaluated for SSR resistance in various environments. Four hundred sixty-six accessions with available
high-density SNP information were used Ito perform both GWAS and GWES. Disease severity (DS),lesionlength
(LL), and wilt score (WS) were observed depending on the environment. Putative candidate genes underlying
associated loci were used to understand the different mechanisms that underpin SSR resistance in soybean. For
further validation, transcript levels ofseveral putative candidate genes were compared in resistant and suscep-
tible breeding lines using RNAseq, and approximately half of the putative candidate genes were differentially
expressed.
Results and Discussion
Phenotypic variation. Previous efforts to dissect the genetic architecture of SSR resistance in soybean
included three GWAS17-19 These studies were done in controlled environments for phenotypic expression, but
differed lin the genetic background (101-330 lines ranging from elite cultivars to landraces) and number of mark-
ers (7,864-25,179) used. The present study is the firstto phenotype severalhundred soybean accessions' reactions
toSSRinmultiple greenhouse and fieldexperiments. Experiments were analyzed separately to capture expression
ofresistant loci in different environments and to develop a more comprehensive understanding ofthis complex
trait.
Under 2014 field conditions (14FLD), the maximum emergence rate was 88.9%, and SSR symptoms were
not observed in 61 accessions of the association panel evaluated. Within these 61 accessions, plant emergence
numbers varied from 1 to 24 plants (3.7-66.7% emergence). In subsequent experiments, SSR symptoms were
observedin all accessions. Disease developed rapidly in young plants inoculated in 2014 greenhouse environ-
ments (14GHSE) compared to older plants inoculated in 2015 greenhouse environments (15GHSE). In 2015
field lenvironments (15FLD), methods used to maintain disease promoting conditonsindudedincresed canopy
density andlengthened irrigation schedule to confer an elongated period of cool, damp conditions. Natural wet
weather (Supplementary Fig. S1) favored development ofSSR, which increased the frequency ofhigher severity
ratings (Supplementary Fig. S2). These methods included an increase in seeding rate and decreasing thelength
alleysbetween plots to develop a denser canopy andinoculating plots in the evening in order to capture an elon-
gated period of cool land damp conditions, aiding in the initial infection ofSSR in soybean.
Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between accessions' disease responses varied between and among
experiments (Supplementary Table S1).Plant DS was evaluated in all experiments at R5, beginning seed growth
stage, in field environments, and at three and 14 days after inoculation (DAI) in greenhouse environments.
Within an individual greenhouse experiment, correlation coefficients between traits varied from 0.46 to 0.90. In
general, field experiments hadlow correlation coefficients when compared to greenhouse experiments, ranging
from 0.12-0.17, except for 14GHSE-DAI14, which were below0.05.
The low correlations observedin this study suggest that greenhouse experiments, although informative, do not
necessarily (or always) correlate with field responses. This observation is supported lby previous reports1.,20.21,4-26
Poor correlations to 14GHSE-DAI14 are most likely due to the early growth stage (V3, thirdtrifoliate), at which
inoculation was performed. The rapid spread of disease in this experiment left the bulk of accessions severely
wilted or dead by the time of rating. When plants were inoculated at the V5 growth stage (fifth trifoliate) in
15GHSE, the DAI14 values were more informative with higher correlation coefficients between both years of
field experiments. Therefore, when using greenhouse screenings, the growth stage at inoculation and response
variables measured are vital. With a correlation coefficient of0.32 (Supplementary Table S1), 14FLD and 15FLD
had the highest correlation coefficient between experiments.
Several approaches were used to determine the most resistant accessions for application in genetic enhance-
ment programs: (1) accessions performing equally or better than the resistant check cultivar 93M11 in all envi-
ronments, (2) performance of the most resistant 10% in field environments, and (3) performance ofthe most
resistant 10% in all environments for all traits. Eleven and 14 soybean accessions were identified from the first
two methods, respectively, and PI567264A and PI507491 met the criteria for both (1) and (2) (Supplementary

Table S2). Accession PI567264A was the only genotype that met (3). For field resistance, PI227212 is a key acces-
sion for field resistance as it ranked in the lowest 1% ofboth field trials.
SNP genotyping and genome analysis. A total of35,683 SNPS distributed lover the entire genome were
usedfor association mapping. SNP information was previously prepared using the Illumina Infinium SoySNP50K
BeadChip?7 available through SoyBase!?. The genome-wide inter-marker distance was 26.6kb. Chromosome-wide
densities varied from 39.2kb on Chromosome 1 (Gm01) to only 19.9kb on Gm13. SNPS were also unevenly dis-
tributed within chromosomes. The number ofSNPs within the euchromatic region (80.2%) is much higher than
that found in the heterochromatic region. Since only around 22% of genes are found in the heterochromatic
region28, the percentage ofSNPs within this region is acceptable.
The resolution of association mapping depends on the amount of recombination available, which is meas-
uredby linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay rates29,30. LD decay rates were measured: separately for euchromatic
andheterochromatic regions since about 93% of recombination occurs in euchromatic region in soybean, even
though it only accounts for 43% ofthe genome28. When r2 reached 0.23, halfits maximum value, LD decay rate
was estimated at 241kb and 5061 kb in euchromatic andheterochromatic regions, respectively. This LD decay rate
in euchromatic regions was slightlyless than previous reports of around 1350kb using similar panels'3, 16. The aver-
age inter-marker distance (26.6kb) ofthe SNPS was sufficient to capture the variation within the diverse soybean
association panel used in this experiment.
The PI accessions in the association panel had lalow heterozygosity rate of0.6% when 35,683 SNPS with minor
allele frequency (MAF) 20.05 and missing rate <10% were used and reflects the inbreeding nature of soybean.
These SNPS had an average nucleotide diversity (polymorphism information content, PIC) of0.30. This value is
between previously reported nucleotide diversity of0.28 in elite cultivars31 and 10.35 in a broad panel of cultivated
soybean.
GWAS analyses. A total of 15, 10, 15, 11, 9, 19, 4, and 15 significant SNPs were associated with 14FLD,
14GHSE-DAI03, 14GHSE-DAI14, 15GHSE-DAI03, 15GHSE-WS, 15GHSE-LL, 15GHSE-DAI14, and 15FLD,
respectively. Manhattan plots and QQ plots are presented in Supplementary Figs S3-S6. Significant SNPS found
within 50kb of each side ofthe strongest trait-associated ISNP (peak SNP) were clumped together to form a QTL
ifcontained in an LD block with r 2>0.7 with respect to the peak SNP. The peak SNP was kept to represent the
QTL. This condition left a total of7, 3, 12, 8, 7, 10, 4, and 19 significant loci associated with SSR resistance for
14FLD, 14GHSE-DAI03, 14GHSE-DAI14, 15GHSE-DAI03, 15GHSE-WS, 15GHSE-LL, 15GHSE-DAI14, and
15FLD, respectively (Supplementary Table S3). Dueto overlap between traits, 58 significant SNPS were associated
with SSR resistance in all experiments. For individual traits, these loci explained 12-37% of the phenotypic vari-
ation (Fig. 1). The strongest associated SNP, ss715607699 was reportedfor 15GHSE-LL (p-value == 1.69E-06) and
15GHSE-WS (p-value = 8.73E-05). This locus is located within a previously reported QTL33
Overlap between resistantloci were found in 15GHSE. Specifically, two loci were detected for multiple traits
whereas both involved WS. Notably, there was no overlap in loci detected between field environments. The lack
of overlapping SNPS have been previously reported and discussed'S. Since our study used the same genotype
panel and markers for each experiment, the lack of overlapping SNPs was likely due to a QTL X environment
interaction. The lack of correlation between environments can also arise from different underlying mechanisms

controlling resistance in different environments. This agrees with quantitatively inherited traits previously
reported to display significant environmental interactions-36
Comparisons for previously reported QTL were doneby projecting genetic map locations onto the Glyma.
Wm. 82. a2 reference genome physical map' 12. The significant main effect loci from GWAS are presented in
Supplementary Table S3. Significant SNPs for SSR resistance were identified on Gm04 and Gm12, where no
SSR resistance loci have been reported. The genetic background used in previous studies could have inhibited
the detection ofloci on these chromosomes in several ways: lack of segregation in bi-parental populations, low
allele frequency in the panels chosen for GWAS, or marker density resulting in lack ofLD with the causal loci.
This study used 466 diverse accessions to increase historic recombination and decrease LD, with over 35K mark-
ers used to capture the genetic variation and increase the genetic resolution. Twenty-one of the 58 identified
main effect loci co-localized with previously reported QTL for SSR resistance. Ofthese, three loci (ss715599948,
ss715603406, andss715603408) located on Gm08 and Gm09 overlapped with multiple QTL previously reported
for SSR resistance.
Candidate genes were identified for future functional validation and application. These genes serve as a start-
ing point to better understand the underlying mechanisms of SSR resistance in soybean, but should not be misi-
dentified las causal genes until propervalidation. Genes annotated lin SoyBase!2 surrounding the peak SNP served
as the source of potential candidate genes. A 50 kB region on either side ofthe peak SNPS were investigated unless
the significant SNPS were involved in a linkage block (r> 0.7 in respect to peak SNP) that resulted lin a smaller
region to investigate. A total of57 candidate genes were predicted for main effectloci (Supplementary Table S3).
Each candidate gene was assigned a functional categorybased on its annotations. These functional categories give
an idea of the different modes ofresistance in response to SSR infection. Approximately, one quarter of fthe genes
were involvedin signaling, one quarter in defense, and less than 10% in broader categories such as DNA/RNA
(processing, regulation, or organization), protein (synthesis, degradation, modification, or localization), cell wall
(synthesis or degradation of cell wall structural proteins), and membrane (structure, transport, or vesicle medi-
ated transport). Some ofthese functional categories were associated with all experiments, whereas others were
limitedtoa certain experiment. For example, protein candidate genes were only associated with traits measured
in 15GHSE, while membrane candidate genes were only specific to 14GHSE-DAI14.
Signaling. Putative candidate genes with a signaling functional category included those involved with calcium
signaling, G proteins, hormone, and inositol signaling pathway, and general kinases and phosphatases. Signaling
genes such as these were differentially expressed between resistant and susceptible soybean genotypes infected
with S.sclerotiorumin arecent expression analysis". The majority ofthe putative candidate genes identifiedin the
present study were annotatedfor leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinases (LRR-RLK), one ofthe major
families ofplant transmembrane, receptor-like kinases that regulate a wide range ofprocesses, including defense
responses".
Putative candidate gene Glyma.06g314000, associated with 15GHSE-WS, is homologous to Arabidopsis
ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE 3-LIKE 1 (EILI). EILI is a transcription factor that has been shown to play a key
role in the integration of jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) signaling, as well as a role in necrotrophic patho-
gen defense39. Glyma.19g248900, associated with 14FLD, is homologous to Arabidopsis ETHYLENE RESPONSE
FACTOR1 (ERF1). ERF1 isatranscription factor found downstream OfEILI thatisi induced by ET and/orJA and
has an important role in the regulation ofdefense response genes"0.41. These, along with other candidate genes,
suggest the importance ofET and IJA signaling pathways in the defense against S. sclerotiorum.
Defense. Putative candidate genes with a defense functional category were involved in programmed plant cell
death (PCD), both apoptosis and autophagy, or encoded genes related to pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and
their products. Many genes in this category could lalso be dual-classified under signaling. Putative candidate gene
Glyma.12g169300, associated with 14FLD, and Glyma.12g171300, associated with 15GHSE-DAI03, are homolo-
gous to barley (Hordeum vulgare) MILDEW RESISTNACE LOCUSO (MLO). A loss-of-function mutation in mlo
genes confer resistance to powdery mildew fungus (Erysiphe graminis) in barley in a non-race-specific manner
through the prevention offungus penetration*. Additional mutations to the barley MLOlocus show function in
PCD and pathogen defense43.
Glyma.13g328100, associated with 15FLD, encodes a plant, small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase
homologous to Arabidopsis SIZ1, which has been shown to regulate innate immunity*. Mutant plants demon-
strated elevated salicylic acid(SA) accumulation, expression ofPR-genes, and increased resistance to P.syringae.
Double mutants with genes such as pad4 suggest the control of SIZI on SA signaling. Mutations in Arabidopsis
pad4 gene reduce the expression of PR-1 and levels of SA when infected with P. syringae45. Together, PAD4
and SIZI work epistatically to regulate PR expression*. Finally, Glyma.14g042400, also associate with 15FLD,
encodes a putative LRR-RLK transmembrane receptor inducedby chitin oligomers homologous to Arabidopsis
RECETPOR LIKE PROTEIN 52 (RLP52). Chitin is a major component offungal cell walls, and chitin oligomers
are known to induce plant defense cascades.
Transcript level of putative candidate genes. An RNAseq dataset was mined for all available puta-
tive candidate genes detected through GWAS. This was done successfully for 38 putative candidate genes. Of
these, 50% were differentially expressed between susceptible and resistant soybean lines. Out ofthe eight genes
associated with DAI03, five were differentially regulated. Glyma.04g209700, a putative candidate gene (PAD4)
associated with 14GHSE-DAI03, was consistently expressed lat higher levels in the resistant line compared to the
susceptible line throughout the time course of fthe experiment, and at significant levels at 24, 48, and 96hours
post-inoculation (Fig. 2). Glyma.04g209700 encodes a lipase (class 3) protein and lis homologous to Arabidopsis
PAD4. PAD4 is thought to be involved in the regulation of SA and has been shown to affect the activation of

the putative candidate gene associated with 15GHSE-DAI03. Although the function ofthis gene is currently
unknown, it was highly expressedin the susceptibleline, and transcriptlevels were significantly higher compared
to the resistant line (Fig. 3). Its association with SSR resistance in soybean makes this a gene ofinterest, andfur-
ther studies addressing on its function are needed.
GWES interaction analyses. Genome-wide epistatic interaction analysis had not yet been used in dis-
secting the genetic architecture ofSSR resistance. Two lociSNP-SNP interactions were evaluated using a linear
regression executed with PLINK47, 48. The number of significant interactions in field environments were much
greater than those found significant in the greenhouse. This couldbe due to the additional environmental linterac-
tions present within these trials that are otherwise controlledby design within greenhousetrials. After clustering

14FLD and 15FLD,respectively (Supplementary Table S4).The 37 unique lociinvolved within these interactions
were reported on 13 different soybean chromosomes. Nine individualloci were involved in multiple interactions.
No main effect SNPS had an additional significant epistatic interaction. Six ofthe 37 loci involved in signifi-
cant SNP-SNP interactions co-localized with previously reported QTL for SSR resistance. When including all
SNP-SNP interactions and additive effect SNPS, the explained phenotypic variation increased from 30-37% to
33-42% in field environments (Fig. 1).
Putative candidate genes were predicted for loci involved in SNP-SNP interactions. Genes annotated in

fifth ofcandidate genes were assigned to a membhanereatedfuncional category, followed by signaling and cell
wall functions. One category present that was not found among main effectloci was senescence.
Membrane. Genes involvedin transport or gene products that are integral to the membrane were categorizedas
membrane-related. Candidate genes reported for highly significant epistatic loci contained transporters for both
proteins and sugars. Sugars, including sucrose and its products, serve as important signaling molecules for mul-
tiple processes in a plant, including responses to biotic stresses19.50. Pathogens may exploit plant sugar supplies
which may subsequently trigger plant defense responses". The expression of genes that may modify or reallocate
sugar supply have been shown to be altered during these interactions"1.52 Glyma. 16g138800 encodes a vacuolar
glucose exporter homologous to Arabidopsis EARLY RESPONSIVE TODEHDRATION-LIKE6(AERDL6. This
exporter responds to different stimuli; itis activated during darkness, heat, and wounding and repressed during
cold stress53, Since vacuoles are the major site for sugar storage, the activities ofits sugar transporters can deter-
mine plant stress tolerancess. Interestingly, Glyma.16g138800 is in an epistatic interaction with Glyma.06g166800,
which encodes a sucrose efflux transporter homologous to Arabidopsis SWEET12 (AISWEET12) and Medicago
truncatula MTN3. Glyma.06g166800 is involved in several epistatic interactions with multiple other genes on
Gm16 whose functions include sugar transporters, protein transporters, secondary metabolites, and transcrip-
tion factors. SWEET12is localizedin the plasma membrane of the phloem and mutants are hypothesizedto limit
sucrose availability in the apoplasm in order to prevent pathogen infections6.
Cell wall. Putative candidate genes with a cell wall functional category were involvedin the synthesis or degra-
dation ofstructural components such as cellulose and pectin. During infection, S. sclerotiorum facilitates
tration and degrades cell wall components by secreting a range of cell wall degrading enzymes eclibespene
Therefore, cell wall composition is an important line of defense in host plants andhas been shown to be differ-
entially expressed between susceptible and resistant soybean genotypes infected with S. sclerotiorum". Putative
candidate gene Glyma.14g026200 encodes an acyl-esterase found in powdery mildew resistant 5 (pmr5) andis
homologousto/Anabidopsis TRICHOME BIREFRINGENCE-LIKE 27 (TBL27)5. 60. Arabidopsis plants containing
a mutant pmr5 gene were resistant to powdery mildew and contained cell walls that were pectin enriched with
additional pectin modifications".
Senescence. Two candidate genes specifically related to senescence were identified. These candidate genes had
epistatic interactions with loci associated with signaling candidate genes that also play a role in flowering and
senescence. Although senescence itself plays a minor role next to S. sclerotiorum oxalic acid-induced PCD61,
these senescence genes may also function in the regulation ofhost PCD, thus directly affecting the establishment
of S. sclerotiorum and disease outcome62. Glyma.12g059200 encodes an alcohol dehydrogenase homologous to
Arabidopsis SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENE 13 (SAG13). SAG13 is an established marker gene for senes-
cence. It lacks basal mRNA expression in young leaves and is detected in high amounts prior to the onset of
senescemer.Gym.l9sso encodes a glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase (GDPD)homologous to
Arabidopsis SENESCENCERELATEDGENE 3 (SRG3) and Arabidopsis GDPD164
Using a high mapping resolution, 58 main effect and 24 epistatic interactions were associated with SSR resist-
ance in soybean when tested for various traits in multiple environments. Putative candidate genes identified
multiple modes of resistance, including signaling pathways, defense-related, and cell wall functions establishing
the complexity ofresistance mechanisms. The lack of foverlap in experiments is driven by differing mechanisms
andloci, and point that plants have alternate systems to cope with SSR infection depending on the environmental
conditions. Since S. sclerotiorum infects multiple different species, the results and discussion presented in this
paper may be applicable to its many other hosts.
Gene Networks. GWASand GWES results were combinedto propose a putative disease resistance model
based on the S. sclerotiorum - soybean interaction, and the newly presumed hemibiotrophic nature ofthe fun-
gus6s. The putative candidate genes clustered into SA,JA, and ET pathways, indicating the possible involvement
ofa complex hormonalnetwork typically activatedby both necrotrophic (ET/JA) andbiotrophic (SA) pathogens.
This approach allowed the annotation of candidate genes with particular interest (PAD4, EIL1, and ERF1) identi-
fied in this study to the proposed model, giving support to the pathways of defense against biotrophs and necro-
trophs for S. sclerotiorum (Fig. 4). The putative candidate genes, PAD4, EIL1, and ERF1, formed la gene network
andincluded severalother candidate genes identified in this study (Supplementary Fig. S7). Twenty-one putative
candidate genes interacted at first level when PAD4, ERF1, and LEILI were considered (8 in SA, 9in JA, and 5in
ET). The PAD4 gene, as previously indicated, was significantly upregulatedat 24, 48, and96hours in the RNAseq
experiment, and seems to be crucial for the S. sclerotiorum - soybean disease interaction.
Conclusions
Multiple resistant accessions identified in this study will be useful sources for the development of soybean culti-
vars with improved SSR resistance. Although greenhouse environments provide a less labor-intensive option for
resistance screening, low correlations establish the importance ofutilizing specialized SSR nurseries represent-
ative of field production systems. The complex genetic control of fSSR resistance in soybean is evident with the
identification of 58 main effectloci and 24 epistatic interactions. The reportedcandidate genes are involvedin cell
wall structure, hormone signaling and sugar allocation related to plant immunity, further revealing the complex
nature ofSSR resistance mechanisms. The results presented indicate that SA, JA, and ET pathways are impor-
tant for resistance to SSR in soybean, and suggests that this pathogen-host response includes defenses against
biotrophs and necrotrophs indicating a hemibiotrophic nature but requires functional validation to develop a
more comprehensive model for S. sclerotiorum-soybean disease recognition andresponse pathway.

Methods and Materials
Plant material. Phenotypic evaluation consisted of 474 diverse soybean accessions from groups I,II, and
III maturity as described by Hill et al.66. For genome-wide studies, genotypic information was available for 466
accessions. Accessions were obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soybean Core
Germplasm Collection curatedby Dr. Randy Nelsonin Urbana, IL67. DuPont Pioneer cultivars 92Y83 and 193M11
were grown as susceptible and resistant SSR performance checks, respectively. In 2015 field (15FLD)experiments,
AxN-1-55 and PI567157A were grown as additional ISSR resistant checks68.
Phenotypic evaluation. Fieldenvironments. Soybean accessions were planted on May 23, 2014 and June
01, 2015in a disease nursery fieldlocated at the Horticultural Research Station near Ames, IA with two replica-
tions in a randomized complete block (RCB) design. In both years, entries were planted lin one-row, 1.5 m long
plots, spaced 175cm between adjacent plots. In 2014, plots were spaced with 1.5m alleys and the seeding rate was
five to six seeds per 30cm. In 2015, alleys werereducedto 90 cm and the seeding rate was eight seeds per 30cm to
create a denser canopy and promote disease development and spread.
Sclerotinia sclerotiorum culture used in 14FLD was started from surface-disinfested sclerotia collectedin 2013
from a field in Northeast Iowa. After the 2014 growing season, sclerotia were collected from the SSR disease
nursery field located near Ames, IA for use in the subsequent year. Cultures were maintained on potato dextrose
agar (PDA) at room temperature. Soybean accessions were inoculated using the cotton pad method described by
Bastien et al.69. The first set ofinoculum was grown when maturity group I plots reached V5 growth stage70 on
June 27,2014 and July 08, 2015.
Inoculations took place at 7 am starting on July 03, 2014 and at 5 pm starting on July 15, 2015. Inoculations
times were planned to avoid the hottest parts of the day to facilitate pathogen survival and infection. Plots that
had reached crop growth stage R170 (50% flowering) were inoculated by placing an infested cotton ball on the
lowest flowering node on the main stem. Each plant in a plot was inoculated. There was a total of five inoculation
days, spread six to seven days apart to ensure that each row was inoculated at the R1 growth stage. Fields were
irrigated using overhead sprinklers until rating was completedto create an epiphytotic disease nursery.
Ratings were completed on Aug 26, 2014 and Sept 09, 2015 when plants reached the growth stage R5, about
30 days after inoculation (DAI). SSR disease ratings (per plant) were taken according to the system developed
by Grau et al.10. The DS scale was based on a 0-3 scale: 0= no symptoms, 1= lateral branches showing lesions,
2= lesions on main stem, and 13 = lesions on main stem resulting poor pod-fill or plant death.
Greenhouse environments. In 14GHSE, soybean accessions were evaluated using a RCB design with two replica-
tions. Entries were pre-germinated for 4-7 days at room temperature, and one healthy seedling was transplanted
into a Ray Leach cone-tainer (Stuewe and Sons, Inc.) on Dec 15, 2014. Cones were placed on a rack with blank
rows spaced between plantedrows. Accessions were placed lin a greenhouse set at 20-25Â°C2 71 Natural light was
usedin combination with high pressure sodium lights to provide a 16-hour photoperiod.
Soybean accessions were inoculated when the third trifoliate was fully expanded, approximately four weeks
after transplanting. The inoculation procedure was adapted from Guo et al.72 and herein referred to as the

cut-petiole method. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum cultures were started from surface-disinfested sclerotia collectedin
2014 from SSR field lexperimentlocated near Ames, IA.
After inoculation, plants were placed inside a moisture chamber for a 48-hour incubation period. The cham-
ber was constructed using PVC pipe and clear plastic. An Idylis Evaporative Humidifier was run at full capacity
inside the moisture chamber to increase relative humidity during incubation. After the incubation period, the
moisture chamber was removed land previous conditions were resumed.
In 15GHSE, phenotypic data was collected from a randomized layout with a single replication. Three seeds
were directly planted into 8oz. styrofoam cups for each soybean accession on Mar 31, 2015. At VC (unifoliate
growth stage), cups werethinned down to two plants. Cups were spread out on April 23 andfertilizedon April 29
with 200ppm of Peters@ Excel(15-5-15) to facilitate plant growth. Accessions were inoculated when the fifth tri-
foliate was fully expanded (Vs).approximately six weeks after planting. Conditions and linoculation procedure
were as described previously, cutting the third youngest fully expandedtrifoliate.
Plants with SSR were rated for DS in both years. Disease severity was based on the scale previously described
and taken on two separate dates: three and 14 DAI designated as DAI03 and DAI14, respectively. In 15GHSE
experiments, WS and LL were measured. Wilt score was recorded as the number ofdays after inoculation that
wilting or plant death was first observed. Scores were taken every other day from three to nine DAI, with a final
rating at 14 DAI. Plants that did not observe wilting by the final rating were given a fixed score of 20 to represent
resistance. Lesion length was recordedin mm as the length ofvisible lesion or discoloring on the main stem at
seven DAI This includedlesions above and below the infection court.
Statistical analysis of phenotypic data. All experiments and years were analyzed separately. When an
experiment was replicated and the disease response was ordinal, an ordinallogistic regression with proportional
odds assumption was used to obtain BLUPS for each accession (14FLD, 14GHSE-DAI03, 14GHSE-DAI14, and
15FLD). A mixed model approach was chosen to accommodate the unbalanced sample size among cultivars due
to emergence rates. The analysis was performed using the clmmfunction (part tofthe ordinal package") executed
intheRstatisialanalyis software version 3.2.174. The model for both field experiments (14FLD and 15FLD) was

where 0, is the intercept for the ith response category (i=0, 1, 2), R is the effect ofthe jth replication, Ak is the

logit(Tijk) = 0, + R; + Ax.
Duetolack ofreplication in 15GHSE experiments, phenotypic data for each accession consisted ofthe average
response ofthe two plants.
Genotyping and quality control. The SNP data was prepared by Song et tal.27 using the Illumina Infinium
SoySNP50K BeadChip. For the soybean accessions involved lin this study, data was downloaded from SoyBase'2.
Genotype data was accessible for 466 accessions and these accessions comprised the association mapping panel.
Of the 42,180 SNPS availablefrom these accessions, 284 SNPS that were presented in unanchored sequence scaf
folds were excluded from further analyses. The dataset had la missing rate of0.5%. Individual markers with miss-
ing rate larger than 10% were omitted landthe remaining missing data were imputed using BEAGLE version 3.3.1
with default parameter settings75,76. SNPS with a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5% after imputation were also
omitted for further analyses. A total 35,683 SNPS were used for GWAS and GWES.
Glyma.Wm.82.a2 reference genome was usedto obtain chromosome physical lengths (bp) through SoyBase12
which were used to calculate genome-wide inter-marker distance and chromosome-wide densities. Pairwise LD
between markers was measured lusing the squared correlation coefficient (r) between alleles using the Rpackage
synbreed". Due to the variability ofrecombination between euchromatic and heterochromatic regions, r2 was
calculated separately for these two regions. SoyBase!2 was used to outline the boundaries ofthe euchromatin and
heterochromatin regions. The average LD decay presented used only the r for SNPS with pairwise distance less
than 10Mb in either region of each chromosome by R script implementing the equation described in a previous
study 78. The LD decay rate ofthe population used was measured as the chromosomal distance where the average
rdroppedtol half fofits maximum value79.
Nucleotide diversity was measuredby polymorphism information content (PIC). The equation used was
PIC, == 1  (MAF? + (1 - MAF)) - 2*MAF,*(1 - MAF),
where MAF,is the minor allele frequencyofthe ith SNP80 The average PIC was calculated at 100kb intervals.

Genome-wide association (GWAS) and epistatic (GWES) analyses. Phenotypic data of each rat-
ing for individual accessions were used to fit the one-way ANOVA model for naive test (without correction for
familial relatedness or population structure) implementedin R74 and three types of models, general linear model
(GLM), mixed linear model (MLM), and compressed MLM (CMLM), implemented in the GAPIT software for
marker-trait association analysess1,82 The threshold for significant associations was determined by the empirical
significance levelofP<0.001. This was evaluated by performing 1,000 permutations ofthe GWAS as previously
described16. Ina genotypic file wherea row representedan individual accession and la column represented la single
SNP, rows were randomly shuffled without changing the row names. This was repeated for each iteration. The
threshold was set as the lowest Pvalue ofthe SNP-trait association that did not meet the empirical lsignificance
level.
Genome-wide epistatic interactions test were carriedoutin PLINK47, 48. The equation implemented was
y = bo + bA + b,B + bzAB + e,
where bo is the overall mean, bi is the additive effects of marker A, ba is the additive effects ofmarker B, ba is the
interaction effect between markers A and B, and leis the random error following N(O, 02). Due to the high num-
ber ofsignificant interaction, a more stringent Bonferroni threshold(a=1 X 10 10) was used to eliminate small
effect interactions that would give a minimal impact on trait expression and genetic cemhancementaplicationsifor
field resistance to SSR.
The proportion of phenotypic variance (R?) explained by significant peak main effectSNPs or the significant
peak main effect SNPS plus significant epistatic effectSNP-SNP interactions were calculated for each trait usinga
fixed linear regression model.
Prediction of candidate genes. Genes annotated in Glymal.1, Glmyl.0, and NCBI RefSeq gene models
available through SoyBase aligning to the Glyma.Wm.82.a2 reference genome!? were used as the source of can-
didate genes. A 50kB region on either side of peak SNPS were investigated unless significant SNPS were involved
in alinkage block with r> 0.7 in respect to the peak SNP. At this point, the more stringent method was used,
resulting in a smaller region to investigate. The peak SNP is defined as the SNP with the lowest Pvalue. The pre-
diction ofcandidate genes resulted from the following priorities: (i) genes ofknown function in soybean related
to disease resistance, (ii) genes offunction-known orthologs in Arabidopsis related to disease resistance, and (ii)
genes pinpointedby the peak SNPS. Functional categories were assignedto each putative candidate gene using
the criteria outlinedby Calla etal.37 based on information given by annotations available in SoyBase' 12 and ITAIR83.
Next generation RNA sequencing. Two isogenic breeding lines of soybean (Glycine max); suscepti-
ble (91-44) and partially resistant (91-145) were used for the experiment. Four week old soybean plants were
infected with S. sclerotiorum by petiole inoculation method" and stem tissue was collected at 0(control), 24, 48,
and 96hours post inoculation. The experimental design consisted ofthree biological replicates for each of fthe
treatments. Total RNA was extractedfrom the plant tissues (stem segment) following the standard Trizol protocol
(Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA), further cleaned lup using RNeasy plant mini kit protocol (RNeasy Plant
Mini Kit, Qiagen, cat. no. 74904, Hilden, Germany). RNA from each sample was randomly fragmented, and
individually indexedlibraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation v2 kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Illumina, San Diego CA, USA). After additional processing, cDNA was sequenced
using Illumina HiSeq2000 (Illumina, San Diego CA, USA). Low-quality bases (Q < 20) were trimmed out from
both the 5' and 3' ends ofthe reads. The quality of feach library was controlled with FastQC. Resulting reads were
aligned to the reference soybean genome Wm82.a2.v1'2 using R Limma package, bioconductor release version
(3.3)84. Data was normalized land differential gene expression was calculated for each gene in reads per kilobase
per million (RPKM).
Identification of Arabidopsis genes corresponding to soybean (Glyma) genes and Gene net-
work analyses. Arabidopsis (TAIR) genes and the corresponding Glyma (soybean) genes were identified
using Tools option with gene annotation lookup at www.soybase.org. These TAIR genes were used in Cytoscape
3.4.0 version with option ofGenemania (load data) network of315considering 27,416 TAIR genes of142,800,814
interactionsss. The interactome was obtained with default settings for all putative candidate genes found in this
study.
