Abstract: Soybean is a globally important legume crop that provides a primary source ofhigh-quality
vegetable protein and oil. Seed protein and oil content are two valuable quality traits controlled by
multiple genes in soybean. In this study, the restricted two-stage multi-locus genome-wide association
analysis (RTM-GWAS) procedure was performed to dissect the genetic architecture of seed protein
and oil content in a diverse panel of 279 soybean accessions from the Yangtze and Huaihe River Valleys
in China. We identified 26 quantitative trait loci (QTLS) for seed protein content and 23 for seed oil
content, including five associated with both traits. Among these, 39 QTLs corresponded to previously
reported QTLs, whereas 10 loci were novel. As reported previously, the QTL on chromosome 20
was associated with both seed protein and oil content. This QTL exhibited opposing effects on these
traits and contributed the most to phenotype variation. From the detected QTLS, 55 and 51 candidate
genes were identified for seed protein and oil content, respectively. Among these genes, eight may be
promising candidate genes for improving soybean nutritional quality. These results will facilitate
marker-assisted selectivebreeding for soybean protein and oil content traits.

1. Introduction
Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is a globally important legume crop, the seed of which contains
approximately 40% protein and 20% oil, accounting for 70% of worldprotein meal and 29% ofvegetable
oil consumption [1]. Soybean provides a great source of human food, cooking oil, and livestock feed,
and has biodiesel production, industrial, and pharmaceutical applications [2]. The phenotypic range of
protein content ofsoybean has been reported to be 34.1-56.8% of seed dry mass, and oil content ranged
from 8.3 to 27.9% [3], suggesting that there is great potential for genetic improvement of soybean
seed protein and oil content. Breeding cultivated soybean varieties with high-protein and high-oil
is an extremely important and promising objective. The negative correlation between protein and
oil content make improvement of both traits simultaneously a challenging task using conventional
breeding [4]. Therefore, the identification of molecular markers associated with quantitative trait
loci (QTLS) controlling protein and oil content is a necessary prerequisite for breaking the negative
correlations between both the traits [5].

Seed protein and oil content of soybean are quantitatively inherited and governed by multiple
genetic loci subject to genotype X environment interactions [6-8]. Given the great agricultural
importance of protein and oil contenti in soybean, many QTLs controlling these two seed traits have
beenreportedover thepasttwo decades. Priorto thisstudy, there were 241 QTLsfor proteincontent and
315 QTLs for oil contentin the soybean genetics and genomics database (SoyBase, https/soybase.org),
distributed over 20 soybean chromosomes. The majority of these QTLs were mapped by linkage
mapping based on biparental populations such as the recombinant inbred line (RIL), F2, and backcross
populations. However, these linkage mapping studies were limited by the relatively small phenotypic
variation of biparental populations and by the fact that only two alleles per locus can be studied
simultaneously. The broad chromosome regions ofQTLs make it especially difficultto identify putative
candidate genes of interest [9-11].
Association mapping based on natural populations offers higher mapping resolution, enables
examinationof a greater number of alleles, andrequires less time for establishing populationscompared
to linkage mapping [12]. Currently, genome-wide association study (GWAS) with high-throughput
singlemucdeutdepdypmophiam (SNP)genotyping has emerged as a promising procedurefor dissecting
the genetic architectureofagronomic, seed composition traitsinsoybean [13-15]. Patiletal.IBlreviewed
the progress in molecular mapping and genomics of soybean seed protein, and concluded that major
QTLs for soybean protein were detected repeatedly on chromosomes 20 and 15. Using GWAS,
Bandillo et al. [16] identified 19 and 18 significantly associated SNPs for protein and oil content,
respectively, and found clusters of strong association signals on chromosomes 20 and 15 using 12,116
G. max accessions from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) soybean germplasm
collection. Zhang et al. [17] and Zhang et al. [18] identified 89 QTLs for seed protein content and
50 QTLs for seed oil content and annotated putative candidate genes using 365 accessions from the
Chinese soybean landrace population. Li et al. [7] identified 14 SNPS correlated with protein content
and 12 SNPS correlated with oil content in a population of 185 soybean germplasms. These studies
confirmed QTLs previously identified by linkage mapping and detected many novel QTLs; they also
indicated that both seed protein and oil content in soybean are complex quantitative traits controlled
by multiple genes. Further surveys are needed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the
genetic architecture of seed protein and oil contentby applying more efficient association mapping
procedures. Particularly, multi-locus GWAS procedures, which do not require multiple test correction
due to their multi-locus nature and which improve the power and accuracy of QTL detection, have
served as excellent mapping procedures [19-21]. Recently, He et al. [22] proposed an innovative
restricted two-stage multi-locus multi-allele GWAS (RTM-GWAS) procedure for a relatively thorough
detection of QTLs and the multi-allelic variation which widely exists in germplasm populations.
The RTM-GWAS has two features that distinguish it from other multi-locus procedures: the tightly
linked SNPS are divided into SNP linkage disequilibrium blocks (SNPLDBs) to construct genomic
markers with multiple haplotypes as alleles, and then two-stage association analysisis performed using
the multi-locus multi-allele model. The RTM-GWAS procedure has been utilized for QTL detection of
100-seed weight [23], seed isoflavone content [24], seed protein content [17], and seed oil, oleic acid,
and linolenic acid content [18] in the Chinese soybean landrace population. It has also been used
for QTL detection of flowering date [25] and drought tolerance at the seedling stage [26] in a nested
association mapping population, and flowering date of an RIL population [27] in soybean.
In the present study, we utilized the RTM-GWAS procedure to dissect the genetic architecture of
seed protein and oil content in an association panel of 279 soybean accessions which was collected from
the Yangtze and Huaihe River Valleys in China, an important summer sowing soybean production area,
and the association panel was genotyped with 59,845 SNP markers using restrictionsite-assocated
DNA sequencing. The objectives of this study were to identify QTLs and their multiple alleles for seed
protein and oil content and to deduce potential candidate genes located within associated genomic
regions in order to facilitate the genetic improvement of seed protein and oil content obtained through
soybean molecular breeding programs.

2. Results
2.1. Phenotypic Variation of Seed Protein and Oil Content
Table 1 shows that the seed protein and oil content varied widely in the association panel.
Seed protein content ranged from 37.2% to 47.6% with an average of 42.6% in 2015, and from 36.1% to
49.3% with an average of 42.6% in 2016(Figure S1A). Seed oil content ranged from 15.2% to 21.4% with
an average of 18.5% in 2015, and from 14.8% to 21.1% with an average of 18.2% in 2016 (Figure S1B).
A highly significant negative correlation was observed between protein and oil content (r= -0.93;
p-value < 0.0001) (Figure S2). The broad-sense heritabilities were estimated as 80.4% and 79.0% for
protein and oil content, respectively. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results (Table 1) showed
significant differences across accessions, and a significant accession X environment interaction for both
protein and oil content.

2.2. Genetic Diversity and Population Structure Analysis Based on SNPLDB Markers
Among the 279 soybean accessions of the association panel, 59,845 SNPs with minor allele
frequency (MAF) 25% were identified by restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) and
organized into 8148 SNPLDBS, ofwhich 4402 SNPLDBS comprised multiple SNPS, while the remaining
3748 SNPLDBS comprised only a single SNP. There were 2-12 alleles with an average of 3.1 alleles
for each SNPLDB, and the average MAF significantly decreased to 0.115 due to the increase in the
number of allele per marker, as compared with the average MAF (0.217) of SNP markers having only
two alleles [28]. The polymorphic information content (PIC) for each locus ranged from 0.091 to 0.842,
with an average of 0.351.
A previous study suggested that there were three distinct subpopulations in this association panel
based on SNP markers [28]. Similarly, in this study, the most likely value of K was 3based on delta
K information from the STRUCTURE analysis using SNPLDB markers (Figure 1A), suggesting that
the association panel could be partitioned into three genetically distinct subpopulations (Figure 1B).
This result is also in accordance with eigenvector analysis (Figure 1C), and a heatmap of the genetic
similarity coefficient (GSC) matrix based on SNPLDB markers (Figure 1D).

2.3. Genome-Wide Association Study for Seed Protein and Oil Content
In this study, 279 soybean accessions with 8148 SNPLDBS were used to perform association
study using the multi-locus multi-allele RTM-GWAS procedure developed by He et al. [22]. The top
10 eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues from the GSC matrix calculated based on genome-wide
SNPLDBS were incorporated as covariates for population structure correction.
For seed protein content, 26 QTLs distributed on 15 chromosomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7,8, 9, 10,
13, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20) were detected, and the -log P values of these QTLs ranged from 2.1 to 56.1.
The genetic contribution per QTL (R?) ranged from 0.4% to 16.0%, with a sum of 58.3% of the total
phenotypic variance (Figure 2A and Table 2). Of the detected QTLS, 16 large-contribution QTLs
(R2 X 1%) collectively explained 51.4% of phenotypic variation, while 10 small-contribution QTLs
(R2 < 1%) explained la total of6.9% ofphenotypic variation. The QTLgProt-20-3located on chromosome
20 explained 16.0% of the phenotypic variation, providing the largest genetic contribution of the
detected QTLS for seed protein content, with the second and third largest genetic contributions made
by qProt-8-1 at 8.0% and qProt-7-1 at 4.7%, respectively.
For seed oil content, 23 QTLs located on 13 chromosomes (1, 3,4,6,7,8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18,
20) were identified, and their -log P values varied from 2.3 to 55.0. The genetic contribution of per
QTL (R?) varied from 0.4% to 15.1%, collectively accounting for 53.1% of the phenotypic variance
(Figure 2B and Table 3). Among the detected QTLS, 17 large-contribution QTLs (R2 N 1%) collectively
explained 49.6% of phenotypic variation, while six small-contribution QTLs (R2 < 1%) explained a
total of 3.4% of phenotypic variation. The QTL qOil-20-1 on chromosome 20 explained 15.1% of the
phenotypic variation, which had the largest genetic contribution of the identified QTLs for seed oil

of alleles. There were 48 and 45 positive (increased protein or oil content) and 50 and 35 negative
(decreased protein or oil content) alleles for seed protein and oil content, respectively. The allelic effect
sizes ranged from -2.50% to 3.47% for seed protein content, and -1.36%to 1.02% for seed oil content,
while the majority of the allele effects varied between -1% and 1% (Figure 3A).

Figure 3. The allele effects of the QTLs associated with the seed protein (A) and oil (B) content detected
in the soybean association panel. The red and green bars which take turns represent the different QTLS,
respectively. The bars above the abscissas represent positive values while the bars below the abscissas
represent negative values. There are 26 QTLs with 98 alleles for seed protein content (A) and 23 QTLs
with 80 alleles for seed protein oil content (B), respectively.
As shown in Figure 4, the allele effects of the detected QTLs in the 279 soybean accessions were
organized into 26 X 279 and 23 X 279 (QTL X accession) QTL-allele matrices for seed protein and oil
content of the soybean association panel, respectively. These QTL-allele matrices encompassed the
genetic constitution of the population, including QTLS and corresponding allele effects and frequencies.
No accession contained all negative or all positive alleles on all detected QTLs for either seed protein
or oil content, and the accessions of high protein content (or oil content) had more positive alleles than
those of low protein content (or oil content). The difference between high and low protein content (or
oil content) accessions resulted from the different compositions of the positive and negative alleles.
Most notably, there were many positive alleles in low protein content (or oil content) accessions and
negative alleles in high protein content (or oil content) accessions, suggesting that seed protein and oil
content possessed large recombination potential in the association panel.

2.5. The Common QTLS Associated with Seed Protein and Oil Content
Out of the detected QTLs, five pairs of common QTLs located on chromosomes 1, 6, 8, 10
and 20 were associated with both seed protein and oil content (Table 4), indicating these loci
had possible pleiotropic effects or very tight linkage, leading to a significant negative correlation
between traits. Two pairs of QTLs, qProt-1-1/g0il-1-2 and 9Prot-6-1/90il-6-1, were associated with
two-allele SNPLDB markers, Gm01_50257226 and Gm06_44035193, respectively, and significant
differences were observed between both groups of accessions categorized by alleles of associated
markers using t-tests at the levelp K 0.05 level for both seed protein and oil content. The remaining
three pairs of QTLs were associated with multiple-allele SNPLDB markers, 4Prot-8-1/q0il-8-2 with
Gm08.BLOCK_16237107.16278243, 9Prot-10-3/90il-10-3 with Gm10_BLOCK_38679572.38679818, and
4Prot-20-3/g0il-20-1 with Gm20_BLOCK 30995685_31177423, and there were significant differences
among the accession grouped by alleles of associated markers using the least significant differences
(LSDS) test at the levelp < 0.05level for both seed protein and oil content. Of particular importance are
the common QTLs 4Prot-20-3/40i-20-1, which explained the largest phenotypic variation for both seed
protein content (16.0%) and oil content (15.1%). Additionally, all five pairs of QTLs exhibited negative
relationships between the seed protein and oil content, i.e., alleles associated with increased protein
content were associated with reduced oil content and vice versa.

2.6. Candidate Genes Controlling Seed Protein and Oil Content
For seed protein content, 55 candidate genes in 18 of the 26 detected QTLs were inferred, with
cumulative R2 values accounting for 42.3% of phenotypic variation (Table S1). In the case of seed oil
content, 51 candidate genes in 17 of the 23 detected QTLs were inferred, with R2 values accounting for
43.6% of phenotypic variation (Table S2). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed
using the AgriGO analysis tool (httpy/bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGo); 24 genes for seed protein content
(Figure S3A) and 21 genes for seed protein content (Figure S3B) were annotated and classed into three
GO categories, namely, biological process, cellular component, and molecular function.
3. Discussion
3.1. Efficient Multi-Locus GWAS Procedure for Dissecting the Genetic Architecture ofComplex Traits
The main objective of genome-wide association studies is to identify genomic loci underlying a
given trait and to dissect its genetic architecture, including the number of loci and their respective
contributions to the phenotype [36]. Association mapping is a high-resolution procedure of mapping
QTLsbased on linkage disequilibrium andholds promise for the dissection of complex genetic traits [12].
The mixedlinear model (MLM) [37], which fits the population structure(Q) or the principal components
(PCs) with kinship (K), is the most popular association mapping procedure [25]. However, the MLM
procedure is based on a single-locus model that tests one marker at a time, and the accumulated
contribution of the detected QTLs may be inflated, leading to the overflowing heritability problem.
If a stringent, experiment-wide multiple testing correction is used, false-negative results may occur
with some small-effect loci being rejected [19,22]. Previous studies have proposed several multi-locus
GWAS procedures to improve the power and accuracy of QTLs detection, such as the multi-locus
mixed-model (MLMM) [20] and the multi-locus random-SNP effect mixed linear model (mrMLM) [19].
One evident advantage of such procedures is that multiple testing correction is not required because
of thel built-in experiment-wide criterion under the multi-locus model, but such procedures are only

adaptable to bi-allelic SNP marker studies and fail to detect the multi-allelic variation in germplasm
populations. Fortunately, the RTM-GWAS [22] procedure, based on multi-allelic SNPLDB markers,
may fit the multi-allele property of complex traits in germplasm accessions well. The RTM-GWAS
procedure has been widely applied to identify QTLs for soybean agronomic and seed composition
traits in germplasm populations [17,18,23,24], nested association mapping populations [25,26], and
recombinant inbred line populations [27].
In this study, we utilized the RTM-GWAS procedure to dissect the genetic architecture of seed
component traits in soybean from the Yangtze and Huaihe River Valleys in China, and identified 26
and 23 QTLs accounting for 58.3% and 53.1% of phenotypic variation for seed protein and oil content
(Tables 2 and 3), respectively. We also performed the mrMLM procedure based on SNP markers,
and 5 and 10 SNPS were identified with 23.6% and 48.4% phenotype variation contribution for seed
protein (Table S3) and oil content (Table S4), respectively. Among the results of the two multi-locus
GWAS procedures, only two SNPS identified by mrMLM were located close to the genomic regions of
2 QTLs identified by RTM-GWAS for seed oil content, Gm20_31299487, which explained the largest
contribution to phenotypic variation (Table S4), however no common locus was identified with the
two procedures for seed protein content. Although RTM-GWAS detected more QTLs and accounted
for higher phenotypic variation, the comparison between the two procedures was not completely
identical because multi-allelic SNPLDB markers may provide more allele information than bi-allelic
SNP markers. As quantitative traits, such as seed protein and oil content, are controlled by multiple
genes, and the number of markers is much higher than the sample size, itis feasible to simultaneously
perform multiple GWAS procedures, particularly multi-locus procedures.
3.2. Previously Reported and Novel QTLS Detected with Multi-Locus GWAS Analysis
Seed protein and oil content in soybean are complex quantitative traits controlled by many
genetic loci, with the majority of loci displaying minor effects [7,8]. Previous studies have identified
a large number of QTLS for protein and oil content of soybean using linkage mapping in biparental
populations [5,38,39] and association mapping in natural populations [4,17,18,31]. However, known
QTLs should be validated before they are incorporated into marker-assisted breeding programs.
Accordingly, a comparison between QTLs for the two seed component traits in this study and
those in previous studies was conducted based on the physical regions of associated markers
(Glyma. Wm82.al.v1.1).
Of the 26 QTLs identified for seed protein content in our study, 19 of them were located in or
around 54 QTLs found by linkage mapping in the SoyBase database and 6 QTLs were consistent
with 12 QTLs reported previous in GWAS (Table 2). Of those, qProt-20-3, which explained the largest
phenotypic contribution, corresponded to seven previously reported QTLs found by linkage mapping
in biparental populations, including Seed protein 31-1 [40], cqSeed protein-003 [41], Seed protein
1-1 and 1-2 [42], Seed protein 39-4 [38], Seed protein 34-11 [39], and Seed protein 15-1 [43] and was
consistent with five previously reported QTLs found by GWAS in natural populations, including
Gm20_29983050 [4], Gm20_30619328 [31], Gm20 30696195-30779755 [17], Gm20_31150279 [16],
and Gm20_31610452 [29] (Figure S4). The QTL qProt-7-1, which explained 4.7% of phenotypic
variation, corresponded to Seed protein 24-4 [44], Seed protein 33-5 [5], cqSeed protein-009 [9], and
Gm07_9512225 [4]. The QTL qProt-15-1 corresponded to Seed protein 30-3 [45], Gm15_3828443 [30],
Gm15_3919945 [29], and Gm_4026372 [4]. The QTL qProt-6-2 corresponded to Seed protein 13-2[46],
Seed protein 24-1 [44], and Gm06_46040638 [16]. The QTL qProt-4-3 corresponded to Seed protein
36-4 [11] and Gm04_ 39785974-39981932 [17]. The QTL qProt-10-1 corresponded to Seed protein
21-5 [47] and Gm10_139741014. In addition, seven of the QTLs identified for seed protein content
were novel: qProt-8-1, 4Prot-13-1,4Prot-171, 4Pe181.gPm6.191.9Pb.92 and qProt-20-4.
Among the 23 QTLs identified for seed oil content, 18 QTLs were consistent with 39 QTLs found
previously by linkage mapping in the SoyBase database, seven QTLs were related to 12 QTLs found
in previous GWAS (Table 3). Of these, QTL qOil-20-1, which accounted for the largest phenotypic

contribution, corresponded to six previously reported QTLS foundby linkage mapping, including Seed
oil 2-1 and 2-2 [42], Seed oil 15-1 [43], Seed oil 24-30 [48], mqSeed Oil-020 [49], and cqSeed oil-004 [41],
and was consistent with five previously reported QTLs found by GWAS, including Gm20_29983050 [4],
Gm20.3061928B1.Gma0.3115027911629W Gm20_31164168 [35], andGm20_31674614-31694438(18.
The QTL qOil-8-1 corresponded to Seed oil 30-3 [50], Seed oil 34-1 [45], mqSeed Oil-004 [49] and
Gm08_13672776 [32]. The QTL qOil-15-1 corresponded to Seed oil 27-2 [51], Seed oil 39-8 [52], and
Gm15_ 11057018-111561391341 The QTLqOil-16-1 corresponded to Seed oil 5-2 [53], Seed oil 39-12 [52],
Seed oil 43-19 [11), and Gm16_ 31506333-31515376 [18]. The QTL qOil-17-1 corresponded to Seed oil
23-3 [44] and Gm17_5042611 [4]. Furthermore, this study also identified three novel QTLs seed oil
content: qOil-4-1, qOil-8-2 and qOil-10-3.
There were six QTLs for seed protein content and five QTLs for seed oil content that were
previously reported bothl by linkage mapping and GWAS in different populations with different genetic
backgrounds, and the most impactful and stable QTLs should be given priority for gene cloning and

may be feasible and reliable to dissect the genetic architecture of complex quantitative traits.
3.3. Candidate Genes for Seed Protein and Oil Content for Further Study
Candidate gene analysis would be needed for further gene cloning and functional validation.
From the detected QTLS, 55 and 51 candidate genes were identified for seed protein and oil content,
respectively, and these genes were closely or distantly related to soybean seed protein and oil content.
The genomic region (24.5 to 32.9 Mb, 8.4 Mb) on chromosome 20 is a particularly attractive major
commonQTL for seed protein and oil content [4,16,54]. The co-localization of QTL regions for these two
seed component traits could result from pleiotropy or closely linked genes within the same region [55].
Bandillo et al.[16] refined the candidate genes for protein andoil in the 8.4Mb region, andhypothesized
three plausible candidate genes involved in these traits: Glyma20g21030, which is annotated as an
ammonium transporter involved in embryo development, Glyma20g21361, which is annotated as
a conserved oligomeric complex involved in the intra- and intercellular vesicle-mediated transfer
and storage of proteins, and Glyma20g21780, which is annotated as a signal transduction histidine
kinase involved in signal transduction [54]. In this study, the major common QTLs on chromosome 20
were 4Prot-20-3/401-20-1, which were identified in the same region (Gm20_ 30995685-31177423 bp).
The co-localization of QTL regions for seed protein and oil content were similar to those reported by
Bandillo et al. [16] and Hwang et al. [4], and Glyma20g21693 and Glyma20g21726 were considered
the important genes within this region. Glyma20g21693 is annotated as a subtilase family protein,
which is involved in proteolysis and in the negative regulation of catalytic activity. Glyma20g21726 is
annotated as an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH12A1), which is involved in the proline metabolic
process and in oxidation-reduction process (SoyBase). In rice, aldehyde dehydrogenase is needed for
seed maturation by detoxifying aldehydes generated by lipid peroxidation [56]. Further, pathway
analysis showed that gene Glyma04g03180 (qProt-4-1) is involved in the protein catabolic process
and Golgi vesicular transport, Glyma10g29020 (qProt-10-2) is involved in vesicle-mediated transport
and amino acid import, Glyma10g29970 (qProt-10-3) is involved in amino acid transport and embryo
development, and Glyma19g31120 (qProt-19-2) is involved in the glutamate biosynthetic process and
nitrogen compound metabolic process. While Glyma08g21340 (qOil-8-2) is involved in very long-chain
fatty acid metabolic process and lipid metabolic process, Glyma08g21530 (qOil-8-2) is involved in fatty
acid biosynthetic process and embryo development (SoyBase). The eight genes mentioned above could
be promising candidate genes for improving soybean seed nutrients. The results indicated that seed
protein and oil content were complex traits that involve a series of biochemical pathway-related genes.
Therefore, further studies are needed to validate the functions of candidate genes of these two seed
component traits in soybean.

4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Plant Materials and Field Experiments
An association panel of 279 soybean accessions was selected from the Yangtze-Huai soybean
breeding germplasm population, which was obtained from NationalCenter for Soybean Improvement,
Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China. The germplasm population was originally reported
by Li et al. [28] and was used to identify genetic loci and candidate genes associated with resistance to
Phytophthora sojae via association analysis. As a highly important parental source in soybean breeding
programs, this germplasm population was selected for use in the present study.
The association panel was planted in a randomized complete block design with three replicates
in a single row plot with a 1.0-m row length and 0.5-m row spacing. The field experiments were
conducted at Huaiyin Institute of Agricultural Sciences of Xuhuai Region of Jiangsu, Huai'an, China
(latitude 33°31' N; longitude 119°01' E) during 2015 and 2016. The field management was conducted
under local cultural practice.
4.2. Phenotypic Evaluation and Statistical Analysis
The seed protein and oil content were quantified by near-infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy
DA-7200 (Perten Instruments, Huddinge, Sweden) using approximately 15-20 g whole seeds.
The wavelength range covered was from 950 to 1650 nm. Prior to the this experiment, the calibration
curve of NIR spectroscopy was established using about 1000 soybean samples, whose protein and oil
content ranged from 33% to 48% and 16% to 25% of seed dry mass, respectively. The mean value of
three scans of each sample was used in data analysis. The seed protein and oil content were reported
as the relative percentage of seed weight.
For ANOVA, the General Linear Models procedure (PROC GLM) in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA) was used with the genotype, environment, replication within environment and
genotype X environment as random effects. The variance components were estimated using PROC
VARCOMP of SAS 9.4 with the Type 1 error method. Broad-sense heritability (12) was calculated
as 12 =
+ n + 02/nr), where d2 oger and 02 are genotype, genotype by environment
interaction, and error variance, respectively, n is the number of environments, and r is the number
of replicates.
4.3. SNP Genotyping and SNPLDB Marker Construction
Genotype data were obtained from Li et al. (2016). Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing
(RAD-seq) was used for SNP genotyping for the association panel. The input data for SNP calling was
preparedby SAMtools (version 0.1.8) [57] and then SNP calling was conducted with realSFS (version
0.983), based on the Bayesian estimation of site frequency at each site. Quality control was performed
by eliminating monomorphic markers, markers with MAF < 5%, and markers with a missing rate
higher than 10%. The fastPHASE software [58]was used for SNP imputation after heterozygous alleles
were turned into missing alleles. A total of 59,845 SNPs with MAF N 5% were used for further analysis
in the present study. The linkage disequilibrium decay of the association panel was approximately
480 kb, where the linkage disequilibrium parameter (r2), which was used to estimate the degree of
linkage disequilibrium between pair-wise SNPS, dropped to half its maximum value [28].
To fit the property of multiple alleles per locus in the association panel, we grouped tightly
linked sequential SNPs into SNP linkage disequilibrium blocks (designated as the SNPLDBS) to
form markers composed of multi-allelic haplotypes. The different combinations of linked SNPs
in a block could be considered as multiple alleles. The SNPLDB markers may consist of multiple
SNPs (multiple-allele) or only a single SNP (two-allele). The SNPLDB marker construction was
implemented with the default parameters in RTM-GWAS software v1.2, which is publicly available
at htps/github.com/njau-srijrtm-gwas. SNPLDB marker construction was performed as detailed



Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 3041
13of18
by He et al. [22]. In total, 59,845 SNPS and 8148 SNPLDBS derived from them were identified in the
association panel.
4.4. Genetic Diversity and Population Structure Analysis Based on SNPLDB Markers
The genetic diversity of the association panel, including the MAF, genetic richness (number of
alleles) and polymorphic information content (PIC) were calculated using PowerMarker version 3.25
software [59].
The population structure of the association panel was inferred using STRUCTURE 2.3.4
software [60] with the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) model. The K value (number of
subpopulations) was set from 1 to 10 using aburn-in of 10,000, a run length of 20,000, and each K value
was obtained with three independentruns. For determination.ofthe: optimalnumber ofsubpopulations
(K), the delta K value (AK) was estimated as described [61] employing the web-based program
Structure Harvester v0.6.94 (available at httpy/tayloro.biology.ucla.edustructureHarvester) [62].
The subpopulation structure was visualized by bar plot using the web application STRUCTURE PLOT
v2.0 (available at htplbtsmysoreinstrplop [63].
Based on multi-allelic SNPLDB markers, a GSC matrix was constructed to estimate the
comprehensive population structure as described in detail previously [22]. The GSC between two
individuals is defined as the proportion of loci that are in identity-by-state. The scatter plot of the top
three eigenvectors of the GSC matrix was produced with the R package scatterplot3d [64]. The GSC
matrix based on genome-wide SNPLDBS was visualized in a heatmap along with the hierarchical
cluster dendrogram constructed using the average (UPGMA) method and the R function heatmap.2 in
the gplots package (htpyl/cran.r-projgctorg/package-gplots).
4.5. Multi-Locus Genome-Wide Association Study
The RTM-GWAS procedure [22] was performed to dissect the genetic architecture underlying
seed protein and oil content, based on 8148 SNPLDB markers and the plot-based whole protein and
oil content data set under two environments (i.e., all the plot values). The association study was
conducted in two stages. In the first stage, a single-locus association test based on the simple linear
model was employed to preselect markers, and in the second stage, stepwise regression under the
multi-locus multi-allele model featured with forward selection and backward elimination was applied
to the preselected markers to detect genome-wide QTLs. Atboth stages, the 10 eigenvectors with the
largest eigenvalues of the GSC matrix calculated from the genome-wide SNPLDBS were incorporated
as covariates for population structure correction. A significance level of p < 0.05 was used for the
preselection of markers and a level of p < 0.01 was used for the stepwise regression. The conservative
Bonferroni criterion was not necessary to apply here because the built-in experiment-wide threshold
was incorporated into the multi-locus model. The genetic contribution (R?), and allele effects per QTL
were obtained from the stepwise regression in the second stage of the association analysis, and the
total genetic contribution (R?) of all QTLs of one trait is the sum of R2 of all QTLs. The detected QTLs
were named as qPro and qOil for seed protein and oil content, followed by chromosome number and a
serial order on the same chromosome [65].
4.6. Candidate Gene Prediction
The candidate genes from the detected QTLs were inferred according to the SoyBase database
(http-/soybase.org). Firstly, the annotated genes were searched within the interval of associated
SNPLDBS or its flanking SNPLDBS when there was no gene inside the SNPLDB. Secondly, to identify
the candidate genes from annotated genes, the Chi-square test was conducted for the association
between the alleles of the detected SNPLDBS and SNPs in the annotated genes at a significance level
of P < 0.0001. An annotated gene was considered the candidate gene if all SNPs in the gene were
significantly associated with those in the detected SNPLDB. If multiple genes met the criteria, the
gene with the molecular function most closely related to seed protein and/or oil content was selected

5. Conclusions
Seed protein and oil content are two valuable quantitative traits that are controlled by multiple
genes in soybean. In this study, the multi-locus RTM-GWAS procedure was utilized to dissect the
genetic architecture of seed protein and oil content in the soybean association panel from the Yangtze
and Huaihe River Valleys in China. We successfully identified many previously reported QTLs
associated with seed protein and oil content as well as a few novel QTLS, and we obtained the
co-location of QTLs. These results will facilitate marker-assisted selective breeding and positional
cloning of the causal genes for soybean protein and oil content traits.
