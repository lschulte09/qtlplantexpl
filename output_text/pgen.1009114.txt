seed protein and oil. A 2-bp (CC) deletion in GmSWEET39is associated with higher seed
oil andlower seed protein, and has been extensively selected and used worldwide, likely
for higher oil. The intensive use or fixation ofthe CC deletion in soybean breeding result
in low protein in current soybean cultivars, which is a big problem facing the current soy-
bean industry. The knowledge about the genetic basis and identification oftwo major hap-
lotypes for high protein and high oil should be highly significant to address the issue
related to low protein in the current soybean industry and meet dramatically increasing
need for plant-based protein in the food industry. Our successful integrative and "big-
data-driven" approach, which uses the huge amount of genome and transcriptome
sequencing and phenotypic data available in the community, should provide an effective
case study for post-genomic data-driven research.
Introduction
Cultivatedsoybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is an important seed crop grown worldwide. It
was domesticated from wild soybean (G. soja Sieb. and Zucc.) in East Asia approximately
6,000-9,000 years ago and has been further improved through breeding as a major oilseed
crop to provide a source ofboth valuable vegetable oil and protein for uses in food, feed, and
industrial applications [1]. Unlike in Asia where farmers grew locally adaptedlandraces and
selections ofthem for thousands ofyears, soybean has a short history in North America, andit
was introduced to North America in 1765. Soybean had been mostly grown as a forage crop in
North America for the next 155 years until the importance ofsoybeans as a valuable source of
protein and oil was realized at the beginning ofthe 20th century. Starting from the 1920s, soy-
bean has been grown as a seed/grain crop mainly for seed protein and oil. Soybean yield (bush-
els per acre) nearly doubled since 1987 [2], making soybean one ofthe sustainable crops to
meet the rapid demand for plant-based protein and oil for a continuously increasing world
population [3]. However, it was often observed that protein content in seeds is quantitatively
inherited and negatively correlated with seed oil content andyield [4-6], making it challenging
to increase soybean protein content while maintaining the desired seed oil level and seed yield.
In the past decades, over 300 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling soybean seed oil and
protein content have been identified using accessions with the different genetic background
[7], suggesting that soybean oil and protein content are subject to ahighly diverse and complex
genetic control. Although great efforts have been dedicated to utilizing diverse genetic
resources to develop cultivars containing both improved protein and oil traits or improve one
trait without a negative impact on the other trait, progress has been limited. In contrast, it was
observed that US commercial cultivars released over the past several decades contain decreased
seed protein content (itp/luntedsoybeanorg), which is likely an unintended consequence
ofa strong selection for high oil. To effectively exploit the soybean diversity to improve the
seed traits with no or little negative impact on the others, it is crucial to identify the causative
genes/alleles for major QTLs and illustrate the molecular basis underlying their associated trait
interaction and genetic diversity in soybean domestication and breeding.
In the present study, having applied a combination ofhigh confidence bi-parental linkage
mapping using a population of recombinant inbred lines (RIL) and high-resolution association
analysis using 631 diverse whole genome sequences, we mapped a major protein and oil con-
tent QTL on chr15 to a sugar transporter gene and demonstrated that the sugar transporter

gene was preferentially expressed in seed coat tissues. We furtherrevealed that a 2-bp (CC)-
deletion in the gene was associated with the variation of seed oil and protein content. The CC
deletion was selected during soybean domestication and improvement. Haplotype analyses
showed that a CC deletion-carrying haplotype is widely present in cultivated soybeans grown
worldwide and has been fixed in US modern soybean breeding, highlighting the significance
ofthe high-oil CC-deletion haplotype in soybean improvement. The CC-deletion allele also
contributes to low protein in modern soybean cultivars, a big problem facing the current soy-
bean industry. Our result will greatly advance our understanding of fthese complex seed quality
traits and benefit seed improvement in soybean.
Results
Linkage analyses identified a major QTL region controlling both seed oil
and protein content
A population of300 RILS was used for linkage analyses. The two parentallines exhibited signif
icant differences in seed oil and protein content, with Williams82 (G. max) seeds containing
39.33% protein and 20.47% oil content, and PI479752 (G. soja) containing 43.99% protein and
9.82% oil content (SIA Fig). RILS varied widely in seed oil (9.82-20.47%) and protein (37.64-
47.99%), and protein and oil content were negatively correlated in the RILS (r = -0.76) (Fig
1A). Broad-sense heritability (H?) ofoil and protein in the RILS across two-year tests were 0.87
and 0.82, respectively, indicating that both traits were mainly controlled genetically which
allows a substantial genetic improvement ofoil and protein content.
Composite interval mapping with the SoySNP50K genotyping data identified two major
QTLs on chr15 and chr20 (S1CI Fig). We focused on the QTL on chr15 in this study. Two over-
lapping QTLS, qSeedOil_15 and qSeedPro_15, for oil (LOD = 12.95) and protein
(LOD = 10.84) were identified respectively (Fig 1B). qSeedOil_15was flankedby two markers
Gm15_2391075.G_A and Gm15_6028005_AG (8.94-29.10 CM), while qSeedPro_15 was
flanked by Gm15_1989918_T.G and Gm15_5829758.G_T (7.18-28.21 cM). Both QTLs phys-
ically spanned approximately 4 Mb (physical interval, chr15: 2.0-6.0 Mb) and 92.0% of the two
QTLintervals overlapped. This region coincided with previously-published major QTLs for
seed oil or protein content in soybean [4,8-11], indicating that this region contained a major
QTL gene(s) contributing significantly to thel large variation in both protein and oil content.

QTL
To uncover the gene(s) underlying qSeedOil 15 and qSeedPro_15, we carried out association
analyses ofthe two traits with DNA variants within the 4 Mb QTL region using a panelof631
diverse wild and cultivated soybean accessions collected worldwide. Accessions in this panel
had a wide variation in seed protein (32.5-52.3%) and oil content (10.1-23.5%). Overall, the
two traits were significantly negatively correlated (r = -0.62) (S1B Fig). We analyzed the whole
genome sequences ofthe 631 accessions and identified la total of96,813 DNA variants includ-
ing 79,725 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS) and 17,088 insertions and deletions
(indels) in this 4-Mb region. These DNA variants in the region were tested for their associa-
tions with oil and protein. The association analysis revealed that three most significantindels

variants spanning a 34-kb region that was highly significant (p < le-5) for seed oilin this
panel (Fig 1C). The three most significant indels were also highly significant for protein con-
tent (S2 Table). This finding was consistent with the observation that the two QTLs were

GmSWEET39 pleiotropically associated withmultiple seed quality traits
highly overlapped in the linkage mapping analysis describedabove (Fig 1B), strongly suggest-
ing that seed oil and protein might be controlled by the same locus.
The three most significant variants were alllocated within the genomic region of Gly-
ma.15G049200. The indel DT15_3875101 (--/CC, reference/alternative allele) located in the
coding region (exon 6), while the other two, DT15_3875621 (TATCI----) and DA15_3874703
(--/TA), located in the 4th intron and the 3 untranslated region (UTR) respectively. The CC
indel was polymorphic in two parents ofthe RIL population. The high-oil and low-protein
parent (Williams82) contained the CC deletion (CC-) that was not present in the low-oil and
high-protein parent (PI479752). The CC deletion in the coding sequence (CDS) of Gly-
ma.15G049200 caused a frameshift (see below). We examined Glyma.15G049200 genomic
sequences of631 accessions in the association panel and identified two G. max accessions con-
taining the gene sequence identical to Williams82-type allele except for the CC deletion. The
two accessions contained significantly lower oil content and higher protein in seeds than
accessions carrying the Williams82-type allele (p < 0.05, see haplotype analysis section, H1 VS
H2, Fig 4A and 4B), confirming that the CC indel rather than the other two non-CDS DNA
variants was causative ofoil and protein variation. We also examined the parental lines
(PI468916, PI407788A, PI483460B and Williams82) ofbi-parental linkage mapping popula-
tions whose protein and oil QTLS were mapped to the genomic regions overlapped with qSee-
dOil 15 and qSeedPro_15 [8, 10, 12]. Sequence alignments revealed that DT15_3875101 in
exon 6 was the only variant in Glyma.15G049200 among these accessions fully associated with
oil land protein content (Fig 1E). Notably, seeds ofthese accessions with the CC presence (CC
+) in Glyma.15G049200 contained 9.5% less oil (p<0.001) and 4.6% more protein (p<0.05)
than those with the CC deletion (CC-) (Fig 1F). Thus, the CC InDel, not the other two DNA
variants, is the causative allele for variation of oil and protein content. In addition, Gly-
ma.15G049200 was the only one ofthe six genes within the linkage disequilibrium block show-
ing predominant expression in developing seeds (Fig 1D, S2A and S2B Fig), implying that the
role of Glyma.15G049200 was specific to seed filling. Glyma.15G049200 encoded an ortholog
ofthe Arabidopsis AtSWEET15 sugar transporter (AT5G13170) that also plays a role in lipid
accumulation in seeds [13]. Thus, all evidence suggests that Glyma.15G049200 underlies the
QTL on chr15 controlling both protein and oil content and InDel DT15_3875101 in Gly-
ma.15G049200 is the causative allele for protein and oil content variation.
The CC deletion causes the truncated GmSWEET39
Glyma.15G049200 was previously assigned as GmSWEET39 in a SWEET (Sugars Will Eventu-
ally be Exported Transporters) gene family analysis [14]. The CC indel (DT15_3875101)
occurred in the coding region and caused a reading frameshift starting from the 730th nucleo-
tide of GmSWEET39. The frameshift resulted in a premature stop codon and six amino acid
changes at the C-terminus ofGmSWEET39 in Williams82 (Fig 2A and 2B). Thus, the CC
deletion truncated 19 amino acids from the C-terminus of GmSWEET39 in Williams82 com-
pared with the intact GmSWEET39 in PI479752 (Fig 2C). Like its orthologous AtSWEET15
gene [15, 16], intact GmSWEET39 encoded a sugar transporter protein with seven predicted
transmembrane (TM) domains and a cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (Fig 2D). Lack ofthe 19 C-
terminal amino acids and the C-terminal amino acid changes in Williams82-type
GmSWEET39 caused no obvious change in the predicted 3-D protein structure ofthe seventh
TM domain compared to GmSWEET39 in PI479752 (Fig 2E). However, the reading frame-
shift changed three amino acids in the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail that appeared to be highly
conserved in legumes (Fig 2F). Sequence alignment showed conservation between
GmSWEET39 and two AtSWEETS (AtSWEET13, AtSWEET15) in four key amino acids that

transporting disaccharides (Fig 2G). It remains to be determined how the amino acid sequence
change andloss ofthe 19 amino acids affect the activity ofGmSWEET39 and impact oil and
protein accumulation in seeds.
GmSWEET39 encodes a sugar transporter preferentially expressed in
developing seed coat
We examined expression patterns of GmSWEET39 (CC-) in soybean major organs and differ-
ent seed compartments of Williams 82 at different seed development stages using the Gold-
berg-Harada Soybean RNA-Seq Dataset (htrp_/sedgenenetwork.net/soybean), Interestingly,
GmSWEET39 was predominantly expressed in the floralbud and developing seeds (Fig 2H).
Briefly, the accumulation of GmsWEET39transcripts in seeds was detected as early as the
globular stage and reached the highest level at the early maturation stage over the course of
seed development. The transcript abundance significantly decreased after seeds reached the
early maturation stage and lit was undetectable in the late maturation and dry seed stages.

GmSWEET39 pleiotropically associated withmultiple seed quality traits
Before the early maturation stage, transcripts of GmSWEET39began to accumulate in some
subregions ofthe seed coat such as the inner/outer integuments during the heart and cotyledon
stages (Fig 2)). Atthe early maturation stage (Fig 21), transcripts ofGmSWEET39 showed a sig-
nificant accumulation in subregions ofthe cotyledon (abaxial epidermis) and seed coat (paren-
chyma). Notably, the transcript abundance in the parenchyma ofthe seed coat at the early
maturation stage was approximately 60-400 times higher than in the abaxial epidermis and
outer integument at the cotyledon stage. Expression patterns ofGmSWEET39 in the aforemen-
tioned compartments ofdeveloping seeds were illustrated in Fig 2K. These results suggest the
special role of GmSWEET39 during seed development, especially in the parenchyma of fthe seed
coat. In plants, parenchyma is the innermost part ofthe seed coat with direct contact with the
endosperm [17]. This layer is crucialin assimilate unloading from the maternal seed coat and lin
the initiation ofthe storage phase in legumes [18]. Given that GmSWEET39 encoded a sugar
transporter that is specifically expressed in seed coat subregions during seed development, itis
reasonable to presume that GmSWEET39 plays an important role in facilitating sugar transfer
in the seed coat to allocate photosynthetic sucrose into the embryo and that the increased
sucrose accumulation enhances the subsequent sucrose-derived fatty acid biosynthesis [19, 20].
GmSWEET39 has been selected over soybean domestication and
improvement for oil and protein improvement
We examined the indexes of selection in the 1-Mb genomic region harboring GmSWEET39
using the fixation index (Fst), diversity (T) and Tajima's D. The results from these indexes all
indicated that GmSWEET39 located in an approximately 40-kb genomic region that under-
went a selective sweep (Fig 3A), suggesting that GmSWEET39 underwent selection during soy-
bean domestication.

3B). We also observed increases in oil content in CC- accessions over the courses of soybean
domestication (G.soja to landrace) and improvement (landrace to cultivar) (Fig 3C). In CC-
accessions, oil content significantly increased by 4.72% (p < 0.001) from G. soja to landrace
and 1.35% (p < 0.001) from landrace to cultivars. However, oil in CC+ accessions was
decreased by 0.5% during the transition from landrace to cultivars. The increasing trend ofoil
content in CC- accessions was consistent with that ofCC- allele frequency over the transitions
in G. soja-landrace-cultivar (Fig 3C), suggesting that the CC- allele rather than CC+ allele was
selected and used for high oil during both domestication and improvement processes.
In consistence with observed negative relationship ofoil and protein content, protein con-
tent reduced in CC-accessions during the domestication and improvement (Fig 3D). Protein
content was decreased in CC+ accessions from G. soja tolandrace. On the contrary, protein
content was significantly increasedby 4.38% (p < 0.001) in CC+ accessions during the transi-
tion from landrace to cultivar. This finding with protein changes suggested that CC+ allele of
GmSWEET39 might be selected and used for developing high protein cultivars during the
improvement process. These observations implied that soybean might experience two paths
for soybean oil and protein improvement using the two distinct alleles of GmSWEET39: CC-
has been selected/used for oil improvement the over the courses ofsoybean domestication and
improvement while CC+ allele has been selected/used for developing high protein cultivars
during the improvement of G. max accessions.
We further examined oil and protein content difference between CC- and CC+ accessions
within each germplasm group. Oil was averagely higher in CC- than CC+ accessions within
wild (2.8% increase), landrace (2.94% increase, P < 0.001), and cultivar (4.80% increase,
P < 0.001) (Fig3C). Accordingly, protein content in CC- accessions was lower than CC
+ accessions within each ofthe three groups (2.70% decrease in wild, 1.15% decrease in land-
race) with the greatest difference seen in cultivars (6.53% decrease, P < 0.001) (Fig 3D). These
results were supportive ofthe pleiotropic roles of GmSWEET39 on oiland protein. Notably,
more dramatic differences for both oil and protein content between CC- and CC+ accessions
in cultivars than landrace were observed. This could be the result of differentially integrating
oil-favor alleles and protein-favor alleles of fother QTLsin CC- and CC+ accessions during soy-
bean improvement for high oil and high protein cultivars, which augment the difference of
CC- and CC- cultivars in protein and oil.
Discriminatory uses of the two major haplotypes in oil and protein
improvement
We performed a haplotype analysis for the accessions used in the association panel by examin-
ing the sequence diversity ofthe transcribed genic region of GmSWEET39 and the 1.0kb
region upstream ofthe start codon (ATG). Based on patterns ofthe fragment variants, we
identified 19haplotypes with each detected in at least two accessions (Fig 4A, S3 Table).
H1-H4 haplotypes were uniquely present in G. max, while H5-19haplotypes were restrictedto
G. soja. CC- was specifically present in H1 haplotype and its accessions accounted for 70.7%
(335 accessions) of 474 examined accessions, representing the biggest haplotype group. The
resthaplotypes had less than 2.4% haplotype frequency except for H3 with 15.4% (73 of474
accessions). Consistent with our earlier finding, Hl-accessions contained 2.5% higher oil

H2-H4, and much higher oil content (8.25%, p < 0.001) and lower protein (4.14%,P < 0.001)
than all testing G. soja accessions (H5-H19) (Fig 4B). H1 and H2 haplotypes differed only at the
CCindel while H1 contained 3.1% higher in oil (p < 0.05) and 3.4% lower protein content than
in H2haplotypes, further verifying that CC deletion is the major cause ofthe observed differences
in both traits. In contrast, H3 accessions with 2.5% lower oil content (p < 0.001) contained 2.2%
higher seed protein (p < 0.001) than H1. H1 and H3, collectively representing 98.8% ofG. max
accessions in the association panel, were two major haplotypes of GmSWEET39 that contributed
to the phenotypic variations in oil and protein in G. max. However, none ofthe DNA variants
such as CC indel orhaplotype variation of GmSWEET39 accounts for the dramatic differences in
protein and oil between G.soja and G. max. This finding was consistent to the above allelic analy-
sis, suggesting that additional QTLs such as QTL on chr20 might contribute to the observed dif-
ferences in protein and oil contentbetween G. soja and G. max accessions.
We also mapped all haplotypes to their geographic origins aimed to understand the use of
haplotypes in soybean improvement (Fig 4C). Overall, haplotypes (H5-H19) from wild soy-
bean (G. soja) were restricted to East Asia where wild soybeans originated [21]. In contrast,
haplotypes (H1-H4) from cultivated soybean (G. max) had a wider geographic distribution
worldwide (Fig 4C). Ofthe four G. max haplotypes, H1-carrying accessions with high oil (Fig
3B) were widely distributed with 75.52% ofall accessions (253) found in Asia followedby
16.42% (55) in North America (Fig 4D). Itis important to note that the H1 haplotype was
nearly fixed in the United States as 95.92% (47 of49) ofUS-bred cultivars in this study carried
the H1 allele. To further confirm, we examined CC- allele in 75 historically important landrace
and milestone cultivars representing North American soybean breeding history from 1907 to
2002. These cultivars belonged to a wide range of maturity groups (MG) from MG Oto MG
VIII [22]. The CC- allele ofGmSWEET39 was present in all ofthe 75 historical cultivars
including the 22 founder cultivars, which have been used in breeding soybean cultivars at vary-
ing frequencies (1-44) during the 95 years ofNorth American soybean breeding (Fig 4E, S4
Table). These results strongly indicated that the CC- allele of GmSWEET39 was a preferable
allele that has been maintained in modern breedingprograms and has been extensively used
for soybean improvement worldwide, likely for oil improvement. In contrast, the accessions
carrying H3, which contained medium levels of seed oil (16.3%) and protein (45.4%), were
mainly from Asia (Fig 4B-4D). H3 contained the accessions that have been used for breeding
high protein varieties, such as PI407788A from South Korea [23] and Enrei from Japan [24].

causative QTL genes and DNA variants/alleles for complex traits within such large DNA
regions. The recent availability of genome and transcriptome sequencing data ofmany diverse
soybean accessions and tissues provide an opportunity to dissect those large QTL regions at a
single nucleotide and gene level to discover their causative QTL genes and alleles. In this study,
having fine-mapped a major protein and oil QTLto a 4-Mb region on chr15 using a bi-paren-
tal RIL linkage mapping based on SoySNP50K Chip genotyping data, we effectively pinpointed
its QTL causative gene and allele to a sugar transporter gene, GmSWEET39, and a 2-bp CC
deletion through an association analysis with almost all SNPS and Indels in the 4-Mb region of
631 diverse soybean accessions. The major protein and oil QTLs have been repeatedly mapped
to the genomic region on chr15 and extensively investigated [4, 8-10, 12, 25-27] in an attempt
to identify their causative genes and alleles because oftheir high effect on protein and oil con-
tent and significance in soybean agriculture since it was first identified in the 1990s [10]. Thus,
integration ofhigh confident bi-parental genetic linkage mapping with the high-resolution
association analysis ofthe large panel of diverse wild and domesticated soybean accessions
should also offer an effective approach/platform to discover causative genes and alleles under-
lying other complex traits in soybean and enhance translation from phenotype- and marker-
based breeding into causative gene/allele based precision breeding.
Agronomic impacts of the pleiotropic GmSWEET39 on soybean seed
improvement
Previous genetic studies mapped both protein and oil QTLs to the 4.0 Mb region on chr15 [8-
10, 27], whereas, whether these traits were controlled by one gene was unknown. Here, we
revealed that the complex and highly correlated protein and oil traits were controlled by a sin-
gle gene GmSWEET39 with two major types ofalleles carrying CC- and CC+ that were highly
associated with high oil andhigh protein, respectively. Differing from the two contemporary
studies locating GmSWEET39 using genetic sweep-inferred approach followed by functional
validation [28, 29], we identified GmSWEET39 and its causative allele (CCIndel) underlying
the long-pursued chr15 QTL using the classic genetics and high-resolution GWAS followedby
uncovering its dual role for oil and protein improvement. Uncovering the causative gene and
alleles for the long-pursued chr15 QTL and the dual functions ofthe GmSWEET39 alleles
allows us to associate it tightly with soybean decades' breeding practices and highlight its
importance in increasing oil or protein during soybean domestication and improvement. Its
agricultural importance was evidenced by the fixation ofCC- allelein the US cultivars during
the 90-year soybean breeding and its extensive uses in soybean improvement worldwide. Our
study demonstrated that the H1 and H3 account for almost all variation of GmSWEET39
(98.8%) in cultivated soybean and contribute to high oil land high protein respectively. Itfits
the pleiotropic role ofchr15 QTL on seed protein and oil content as revealed in our and previ-
ous studies [8-10, 27]. It is likely that different selection pressures on H1 (CC-) and H3 (CC+),
based on distinct needs for high oil, high protein soybean cultivars, consequently affected their
allelic frequencies in soybean population.
The allelic analysis revealed that GmSWEET39 experiences two different paths of selection,
CC- allele for high oil during domestication and improvement while CC+ allele for high pro-
tein during soybean improvement, which was rarely reportedin previous studies. However,
artificial selection for CC- allele during domestication and improvement, in part, accounted
for the decreasing trend ofprotein content across the transition ofwild-andrace-cultivar due
to its negative pleotropic effect on protein content (Fig 3B-3D). In turn, recruiting its counter-
part allele (CC+) would loffer an opportunity to reverse the general decline of protein content
in CC- modern cultivars. For example, Brzostowski and Diers [23] introgressed lahigh-protein

allele ofchr15 QTL in PI407788A into two elite cultivars and showed that lines carrying chr15
QTL from PI407788A contained higher seed protein without significant yield drag compared
to the recurrent parents. The Japanese cultivar Enrei contains high seed protein and has been
used for breeding high-protein cultivars for soy food production to meet Japanese diet need
[24]. Our result show that PI407788A and Enrei carried H3 haplotype. Therefore, H3 haplo-
type is an important allele that still undergoes ongoing selection at the present-day breeding
for high protein content, which is in a great need ofanimal feed and plant-protein based diets
worldwide [3]. Biased presence ofH3 haplotype in cultivated soybeans suggest the haplotype
likely offers additionalbeneficial traits to farmers than the other two haplotypes (H2, H4) ifit
is not caused by a biased population selection. Identification ofthe soybean accessions con-
taining diverse GmSWEET39 haplotypes, knowledge on selection, and distribution ofthe
major haplotypes would allow breeders to effectively select and use appropriate haplotypes for
target-based seed improvement.
It is known that oil and protein content are complex traits controlled by many genes [7].
Oil and protein content in soybean seeds could be the accumulative or epistatic effects ofthese
QTL genes [30]. Other than GmSWEET39, other major QTLs controlling oil and protein con-
tent such as cqPro-20 on chr20 (also identified in our study) and qOil_05 on chr5 [9, 12] may
also contribute to the total phenotypic variation. We observed that oil content increase in CC-
accessions over the course of soybean domestication and improvement, and protein increase
in CC+ accessions during soybean improvement. In addition, higher oil and protein differ-
ences were detected between CC+ and CC- accessions ofmodern cultivar than of wild soybean
and landrace. The increased and augmented difference likely attribute to continuous and dif-
ferential integration ofadditional protein and oil QTLs for higher oil and protein respectively
during soybean domestication and improvement. Uncovering related QTL genes and their
causative DNA variants will provide a more comprehensive insight into the complex genetic
basis underlying the oil and protein variation in soybean and enable us to develop effective
strategies for precisely improving oil, protein or both in soybean.
GmSWEET39 likely functions as a seed coat-specific sugar transporter for
seed development
Ithas been well demonstrated that SWEET proteins function in transporting sugar from
source tissues to sink tissues [13, 16, 31]. Developing seed lis one ofthe major sink organs. In
seeds, cells have been differentiated into distinct tissues with diverse functions over seed devel-
opment. Seed coat including outer integument and parenchyma is located at the interface
between maternal seed tissues and the filial embryo, and it functions as the "transfer station"
to facilitate the movement of unloaded sugar from maternal tissues to the embryo and cotyle-
don [18, 32]. Evidence have demonstrated that this transporting process is mainly mediatedby
tissue-specific SWEET proteins in the interface tissues and those proteins are essential for seed
filling. For example, in Arabidopsis, AtSWEET11, -12, -15 is located to the cell membrane of
the seed coat [13]. The sweetll;12;15triple Arabidopsis mutant is defective in sugar delivery
from seed coat to developing embryo, which consequently results in reduced starch and oil
content and retarded embryo development [13]. Here, we demonstrated predominant expres-
sion of GmSWEET39in outer integument and parenchyma of seed coat tissues at the early
maturation stage. The developmental expression of GmSWEET39 was coincident with the
stage when protein and lipid begin to accumulate in seeds [33]. It should also be noted that, at
the early maturation stage, GmSWEET39 exhibited decreasing gradients in expression in three
connectedlayers of tissues, from the parenchyma (seed coat) to abaxial epidermis (cotyledon)
and to aleurone (Fig 2J and 2K), which was coincident with the possible path of sugar flux

from maternal seed coat to filial cotyledon [13, 34]. Interestingly, we observed that the trun-
cated GmSWEET39 (CC-) had a higher level ofoil content, as evidencedby the H1 VS H2 com-
parison (Fig 4A and 4B) and supported by recent reports that overexpression ofthe truncated
GmSWEET39 increased oil in seeds [28, 29]. Previous studies have shown that replacing or
removing the C-terminal peptide of sugar transporters significantly increased the transport
activity by increasing the affinity for the substrates [35, 36]. GmSWEET39 has ability to trans-
port sugar [29], and our protein structural analysis predicted that C-terminal truncation
changed its cytoplasmic domain structure. It will be interesting to experimentally testifCter-
minus truncated GmSWEET39 can facilitate the sugar transport across the membrane. In
addition, it was observed that expression ofGmSWEET39 positively correlated with oil content
[28], suggesting that expression variation of GmSWEET39 potentially also contribute to oil dif-
ference in soybean population. Taken together, our study suggests that GmSWEET39 is a
highly-specialized protein in transporting sugar from the maternal seed coat to the filial cotyle-
don over course of seed development.
SWEET proteins are encoded by a large and ancient gene family in divergent plant species,
and associated with diverse plant physiological and developmental processes such as disease
infection, pollen growth and seed development [13, 31, 37, 38]. Patil et. al [14] showed that
soybean contains 52 GmSWEET genes that have been clustered into distinct subfamilies.
Diverse expression patterns have been observed for those soybean genes, suggesting that
GmSWEET gene family have been sub-functionalized with distinct expression patterns to
meet diverse needs of sugar transporting for plant growth and response to environmental sig-
nals [14]. Interestingly, GmSWEET39 and its orthologue AtSWEET15 were both predomi-
nantly expressed in seed coat tissues and functioned in regulating oil content [13, 28].
Arabidopsis and soybean have been diverged from each other for 90 million years [39]. The
conservation oftheir gene expression pattern and function suggested that both SWEET genes
preserved an ancient andimportant function in specifically transporting sugar from seed coat
to filial embryo and cotyledon to support seed development and storage reserve production.
Interestingly, GmSWEET15 was identified by its specific expression in the seed endosperm,
and silencing ofit decreased 160-70% sucrose and resulted in severe seed abortion [31]. The
orthologous pair, GmSWEET39 and AtSWEET15, were clustered with GmSWEET15 and AtS-
WEET11 and 12 in the same subfamily [14]. This observation raises a possibility that plants
have evolved an ancient SWEET subfamily to specifically express in those interface tissues to
facilitate transporting sugar from maternal tissues to filial cotyledon to support seed develop-
ment and seed filling. It willbe interesting to examine expression patterns and functions ofthe
other SWEET genes in the subfamily to validate the hypothesis.
Experimental procedures

A RIL population consisting of300 lines and la natural population containing 631 diverse soy-
bean accessions were used in this study. This F2:5 RIL population was derived from a genetic
cross between soybean (G. max) CV. Williams82 and wild soybean PI479752 (G. soja). The
parental lines and RILS were planted at the USDA-ARS farms in Beltsville, Maryland,in 2012
and 2015, respectively, each year with two replications in a randomizedblock design. The
seeds per plant were bulk harvested and air-dried. Seed protein and oil content were quantified
using near-infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy DA 7250 (Perten Instruments, Sweden) at
the USDA-ARS Soybean Genomics and Improvement Laboratory at Beltsville, Maryland. The

ing the two major oil and protein QTLs on chr15 and chr20 by comparing adjusted and non-
adjusted raw phenotypic data, which eliminated the concern of adverse effect of GRIN-sourced
seed phenotypic data (multiple fieldlocations across multiple years) on association power [40].
The soybean accessionsusedin this study and relatedinformation were provided in S1 Table.
DNA extraction and genotyping
DNA extraction was conducted using the CTAB method with minor modifications [41]. The
DNA was extracted from fully expandedleaves collected from the RILS. Qualified DNA sam-
ples were used for genotyping using the SoySNP50K iSelect SNP BeadChip and the SNPs were
determined as previously described [42].
Generation of genome-wide DNA variants at single-nucleotide resolution
The DNA variants used for association analysis were from three sources including the re-
sequencing of G. soja soybean accessions, SoySNP50K BeadChip [42], and the archived
sequencing reads deposited at the public data repository NCBI SRA (htps/www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/sra). A total of91 diverse G. soja, representing over 90% diversity ofthe wild soybean
collection in the US Soybean Collection, were re-sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq 500
sequencer. The sequencing reads from the G. soja collection and NCBI SRA were processed
and aligned to the soybean reference genome Wm82.a2.v1 that was downloaded from Phyto-
zome (mpl/phyeomeig.dec.pny using BWA [43]. The UnifiedGenotyper of the GATKS
pipeline [44] was used for the variant (SNP and indel) calling as previously described [44]. The
qualified variants from the calling met the following criteria: read depth X 5 & quality X 50 &
< 2 SNPS in a 10-bp window allowed. Indel variants were converted to SNP-type variants
compatible with association analysis using TASSEL5 [45]. Read alignments were visualized
using the Integrative Genomics Viewer [46].
Linkage and association analysis
The linkage map was constructed as previously described [47]. QTLs were detected by the
composite interval mappingprocedure ofthe Windows QTL Cartographer v2.5 [48] with 2.5
as the logarithm ofodds ratio (LOD) threshold for detecting a QTL. Association analysis was
performed using the mixed model at TASSEL5, using the merged SNPs from three types of
DNA variant sources describedabove. Variants (SNPS and indels) with a minor frequency
of> 0.05 on chr15 in the population were used for association analysis. The first five principal
components and Kinship matrix calculated using TASSEL5 were included for analysis. We
empirically used P = le-5 as the thresholdto determine significant associations. Student'st-
test was carried out to determine the difference significance.
