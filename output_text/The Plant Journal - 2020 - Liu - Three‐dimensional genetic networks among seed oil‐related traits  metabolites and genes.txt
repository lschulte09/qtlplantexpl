SUMMARY
Although the biochemical and genetic basis of lipid metabolism is clear in Arabidopsis, there is limited infor-
mation concerning the relevant genes in Glycine max (soybean). To address this issue, we constructed
three-dimensional genetic networks using six seed oil-related traits, 52 lipid metabolism-related metabolites
and 54 294 SNPS in 286 soybean accessions in total. As a result, 284 and 1279 candidate genes were found to
be significantly associated with seed oil-related traits and metabolites by phenotypic and metabolic gen-
ome-wide association studies and multi-omics analyses, respectively. Using minimax concave penalty
(MCP) and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) analyses, six seed oil-related traits were found to be
significantly related to 31 metabolites. Among the above candidate genes, 36 genes were found to be asso-
ciated with oil synthesis (27 genes), amino acid synthesis (four genes) and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
(five genes), and four genes (GmFATB1a, GmPDAT, GmPLDx1 and GmDAGAT1) are already known to be
related to oil synthesis. Using this information, 133 three-dimensional genetic networks were constructed,
24 of which are known, e.g. pmomte-GmPDAI-GmfATAzdi content. Using these networks, GmPDAT,
GmAGT and GmACP4 reveal the genetic relationships between pyruvate and the three major nutrients, and
GmPDAT, GmZF351 and GmPgs1reveal the genetic relationships between amino acids and seed oil content.
In addition, GmCds1, along with average temperature in July and the rainfall from June to September,
influence seed oil content across years. This study provides a new approach for the construction of three-
dimensional genetic networks and reveals new information for soybean seed oil improvement and the
identification of gene function.
Keywords: seed oil-related traits, lipid-related metabolites, metabolome-based genome-wide association
studies, three-dimensional genetic networks, soybean.
