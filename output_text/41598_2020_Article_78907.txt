OPEN Genome-wide association identifies
severalQTLs controlling cysteine
and methionine content in soybean
seed including some promising
candidate genes
Sidiki Malle', Milad Eskandari?, Malcolm Morrison3 & François Belzile1s
Soybean is an important source of protein, oil and carbohydrates, as well as other beneficial
nutrients. A majorfunction ofproteins in nutrition isto supply adequate amounts ofamino acids.
Although they are essential for human nutrition, the sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine (Cys) and
methionine (Met) are often limited and the genetic control oftheir contentin soybean seeds is poorly
characterized.This study aimed to characterize the phenotypic variation andidentify quantitative
traitloci (QTL) associatedwith Cys and Met contentin a core set of137 soybean lines, representative
ofthe genetic diversity among Canadian short-season soybean, spanning maturity groups 000-
II (MG000-I1). Significant phenotypic differences were found among these linesfor Cys, Met and
Cys+ Met content. Using both a mixedlinear model and six multi-locus methods with a catalogue of
2.18 M SNPS, we report a total ofnine QTLS and seventeen QTNS ofwhich seven comprise promising
candidate genes. This work allowed US to reproducibly detect multiple novelloci associated with
sulfur-containing amino acid content. The markers and genesi identifiedin this study may be usefulfor
soybeangenetcimpovement aiming to increase Cys and Met content.
Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) is a legume species native to East Asia and now widely planted for its edible
bean, which plays an essential role in global food security'. Although soybeans are classified as an oilseed with
18-23% oil lonamoisture-free basis, its increased production worldwide can be attributed lalso to itshigh protein
content ranging 38-44%2. Soybean seed proteins are categorized as either albumins or globulins based on their
solubility patterns'.The main storage protein is comprised ofthe globulin fraction, accounting for roughly 70%
of the total seed protein. The 7S (B-conglycinin) and 11S (glycinin) polypeptides are the major components
of the globulin fraction. This fraction provides 18 amino acids, including all 10 essential amino acids, but the
sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine (Cys) and methionine (Met) are not present at adequate levels for optimal
growth and development of monogastric animals'.
Cysteine and methionine contribute highly to human health and animal nutrition by preventing cancer, the
development tofcardiovascular diseases and promoting proper function ofthe immune system". Unlike fat and
starch, the body does not store excess amino acids for later use. Therefore, amino acids must be obtained from
food dailys.". Considering their role in maintaining human and animal health and their low level in soybean
protein (<3% ofall lamino acids in seed), developing soybean varieties with improvedcysteine and/or methionine
content is an important breeding objective to address soybean nutritional limitationss. Understanding the precise
genetic architecture ofthese traits and identifying key genes controlling the accumulation of fthese protein frac-
tions or amino acids would be an important step in this direction. So far, fifteen genes encoding B-conglycinins
(CG1-CG15) and five genes (Gyl-Gy5) encoding glycinins have been reporteds.10 (htp/www.soybascorg).
Seed content in sulfur amino acids has been shown to be quantitatively inherited and controlledby multiple
genes3,6. Only a few studies have reported quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with cysteine and methionine
content in soybean seed(SoyBase, https/soybase.org). Qiu et al." predicted 12 candidate genes based on the

synteny between 113 genes from a gene mining ofsulfur-containing amino acid metabolic enzymes in soybean.
These authors also identified many QTLS related to the 7S (B-conglycinin), 11S (glycinin) fractions and Cys/
Met content soybean on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 13, 16, 17, 19 and 20. From linkage mapping, Panthee et tal.s
reported la total ofseven QTLs associated with Cys, Met tand Cys+ Met tcontent across five chromosomes (Gm01,
07, 13, 17 and 18) in a population of 101 Fo-derived recombinant inbred lines (RILS) (N87-984-16XTN93-99),
Using the same population, Panthee et al.12 reported three QTLs associated with glycinin (Satt461, Satt156 and
Satt292), on chromosomes (Gm17, 19 and 20) respectively, whereas two QTLs were detected for conglycinin
(Satt461 and Satt249) distributed on chromosomes 17 and 16. From a bulked segregant analysis in the F,
ping population derived from the cross ofHarovinton and SQ97-0263_3-1a, Boehm et al.13 reported one mat
on chromosome 10 associated with the 7S a' subunit and five QTLs associated with 11S A-type storage protein
subunits respectively on chromosomes (Gm03, 10, 13 and 19). Fallen et tal. 14 detected two QTLS on chromosomes
(Gm13 and 20) associated with both Cys and Met content in progeny ofEssex x Williams 82 (282 Fs9 RILS). All
these QTLs were reported as a result of QTL mapping in biparental populations and resulted in a poor overlap
between the QTLs/QTNS reported in these studies. This is not unexpected since in biparental populations only
two sources of allelic variation are evaluated. Moreover, the major limitation of this approach is that they offer
poor resolution in detecting QTLS15 and the large confidence intervals surrounding the detected QTLs limits
their utility for identifying candidate genes16.
Population-based mapping approaches such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can overcome many
ofthese shortcomingsofthe biparental mapping approach".In GWAS, we evaluate the association between each
genotyped marker and la phenotype ofinterest that has been scored lin a large number of unrelated individuals's.
A GWAS can be achieved using asingle-locus method where markers are tested individually in a one-dimensional
genome scan like the MixedLinear Model (MLM'9) or using ga multi-locus method where effects ofall potentially
associated markers are simultaneously estimated lin a multi-locus genetic model such as the multi-locus random-
SNP-effect Mixed Linear Model (mrMLM?9). Furthermore, the use of next-generation sequencing in the context
of GWAS makes it possible to genotype larger populations of plants with a higher density of markers than was
previously possible and this contributes directly to increasing GWAS resolution.
With a single-locus approach, Vaughn et al.17 performed a GWAS on two different panels (IL-1996 and
MS-1997), exploiting data from the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN.htplwwwarxgrin.
gov/). The IL-1996 panel was composed of 900 cultivarsbelonging to maturity groups (MGs) III and IV, while
the MS-1997 panel was composed of978 cultivars from MGs V through IX. All the lines were genotyped using
the SoySNP50K iSelect Array17 to produce a total of 32 K SNPS with a minor allele frequency (MAF) 2 0.05.
This allowed these authors to identify a total of fourteen QTLS across 10 chromosomes (Gm01, 03, 02, 05, 06,
08, 10, 11, 16 and 20).
Recently, Lee et al.21 used both MLM and a Multi-Locus Mixed Linear Method (MLMLM) to conduct a
GWAS for soybean seed components (including protein, oil, five fatty acids and 18 amino acids) on 313 plant
introductions (PIs). These accessions belonged to MGs 0 (92%) and 00 (8%) and 91% originated from China.
They were genotyped with the SoySNP50K Array and a total of32 K SNPS with MAF20.05 were used for asso-
ciation analyses. Only one QTL on chromosome 15 was associated with both cysteine and methionine. Using
the same approach, Song et tal.19 conducted la GWAS using phenotypic data collected from five environments for
621 accessions in maturity groups I-IV and 34,014 markers genotyped with the SoySNP50K array to identify one
QTL on chromosome 3 and three (on Gm01, 15 and 18), respectively, associated with cysteine and methionine.
None of the previous work resulted in the identification ofhighly promising candidate genes that could be
targeted by breeders for developing cultivars with increased content in sulfur-containing amino acids.
Thus, to obtain a comprehensive understanding of fthe genetic architecture of Cys and Met content in soy-
bean seeds, we used a core set of 137 Canadian soybean lines grown on two sites and four replicates in total.
The best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) value of each line and a set of 2.18 M SNP markers [obtained from
a combined dataset of genotyping-bysequencing (GBS) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS)] were used to
identify marker-trait associations. Both a single-locus method (MLM'9) and six multi-locus GWAS methods
(FASTmTEMMA", FASTmrMLM", ISIS EM-BLASSO4, mrMLM20, pKWmEB25 and PLARmEB26) were used.
Here, we report a total of nine QTLs detected by the MLM method and seventeen major QTNS detected by at
leasttwo ofthe six multi-locus method llocated on 12 soybean chromosomes. In addition, seven strong candidate
genes based on their high degree of fassociation and functional annotation were identified.
Results
Phenotypic variation and correlations among traits. In view of performing a GWAS, we obtained
phenotypic data for the sulfur amino acid content (g/kg TP) onasetof137 soybean lines by growing single-row
plots on two sites (two replicates/site) in 2013. The frequency distributions for Cys, Met and Cys+Met contents
are presented in Fig. 1. All of the seed composition traits examined in this study exhibited a normal distribu-
tion as the p-value ofa shapiro test for the three traits was <0.05 and appeared to be quantitatively inherited.
Descriptive statistics for Cys, Met and Cys+Met contents are presented in Table 1.It can be seen that the amino
acid content varied from 13.5 to 15.0 g/kg on total protein basis (TP) for Cys and from 12.6 to 13.6 g/kg TP for
Met. The total sulfur amino acid content Cys +Met varied from 26.0 to 28.5 g/kg TP. Across all 137 lines, the
means were 14.6, 13.0 and 27.6 g/kg TP for Cys, Met and Cys+ Met, respectively. The least significant difference
(LSD) between two genotype means was 0.3 for Cys, 0.2 for Met and 0.5 g/kg TP for Cys+1 Met contents. An
analysis ofvariance showed that the genotype main effect was a much greater source ofvariation ps0.001 than
the environment and genotype by environment effect, but the latter was found to be a more important source of
variation (p 050.01) for the sulfur amino acid content than the site. A high broad-senseheritability was observed
and ranged from 49 to 62%.

To assess if these three traits were associated, we measured the correlation between them across the two
environments. Allthree amino acid contents were positively andhighly significantly correlated (p <0.001). The
Pearson correlation coefficients between these traits ranged from 0.81 to 0.97 (Table S1, upper diagonal) and
thegenetic correlation explaining the proportion ofvariance that two traits shared due to genetic causes ranged
from 0.89 to 0.97 (Table S1,boldlower diagonal).
Genotyping and SNP calling. Using the Fast-GBS pipeline for SNP calling, 93% of previous GBS single-
end reads (-203 million 100-bp Illumina HiSeq2000) were successfully mapped onto the Wm82.a2.vl refer-
ence genome. A total of 56 K high-quality SNPS were obtained and so called wGBS-derived SNPn. To obtain an
extensive SNP coverage ofthe genome, we used a two-step approach to genotype the 137 lines ofthis association
panel(Fig. S1). In afirst step, we re-analyzed previously obtained reads derivedfrom GBS analysis to take advan-
tage of fan improved SNP-calling pipeline and reference genome. Overall, 93% of-203 million 100-bp Illumina
HiSeq2000 single-end reads successfully mapped onto the reference genome and 56 KI high-quality GBS-derived
SNPS were identified using the Fast-GBS pipeline (see "Materials and methods" section). In a second step, to
further densify marker coverage, we performed the imputation of close to 4.3 M SNPS by using aset of102 rese-
quenced lines (of which 56 were common to both sets oflines) as a reference panel. This fully imputed set of 4.3
million SNPS was filtered to remove InDels and to retain markers with a MAF20.05 and heterozygositys0.1.

This yielded la catalogue of 2.18 M SNPS distributed across the twenty chromosomes (Fig. S2), an average marker
density ofl SNP every 435 bases across the entire genome.
Population structure. Based on a posterior Bayesian clustering analysis performed using a subset of
pruned markers (r2<0.5), the optimum number of subpopulation (k) was 7 (Fig. 2a). A phylogenetic tree in
(Fig. 2b) constructed with the same subset of markers showed seven main branches with bootstrap values? 50%.
Similarly, for PCA (Fig. 2c), the total variance explained by each principal component (PC) decreased from PCI
to PC7 and, after PC7, the variance explainedby eachfurther PC remained llow and stable. Together, these results
suggestedthat k=7 provided la good assessment ofpopulation structure (illustrated in Fig. 2). These subpopula-
tions tended to contain lines belonging to the same maturity group and/or originating from the same breeding
programs and the corresponding Q matrix was used for GWAS.
Genome-wide association scan for sulfur amino acid content. To identify genomic regions asso-
ciated with the seed content in sulfur amino acids, a genome-wide scan was performed using a MLM and six
multi-locus models implemented in the mrMLM package v4.0. A pruned set (r220.9) of SNP markers and a
single phenotypic value (BLUP) for each trait were used.
For the MLM analyses, as can be seen in the Q-Q plots shown in Fig. S3, this method successfully limited
the confounding effects of population structure and kinship as the observed p-values only diverged from the
diagonal (expectedp-values) at the most extreme values (beyond 3E-03 for all three traits). The results of these
MLM Tassociation analyses are presented as genome-wide Manhattan plots in Fig. 3. With the chosen thresholdfor
false discovery rate (blue horizontalline, FDRS0.05), only 0.03% ofthe SNPS (71 ofthe 243 K) were significantly
associated with Cys content, with the uncorrectedp-values ranging from 1.37E-05 to 1.82E-09. There were 41
markers (0.02%) significantly associated with Met content (p-value from 8.02E-06 to 1.25E-08) and 71 SNPs
(0.03%) with Cys+ Met content (p-value from 1.32E-05 to 9.56E-10) as uncorrected p-values.
To identify distinct QTLS, we characterized haplotype blocks formed by these associated SNPS according
to Gabriel et al.27. For SNPS associated with more than one trait, the most significant SNP (lowest FDR, across
all significantly associated traits) was retained to mark a given haplotype block. In total, nine haplotype blocks

(numbered 1-9 in Fig. 3) were defined of which eight were associated with Cys, four with Met and seven with
Cys+1 Met. In three cases, the same QTL/haplotype block was detected for all three traits (QTLs #4, 5and 18on
Gm08, 10 and 20) andin four cases, the same QTL was shared between two ofthe three traits, Cys and Cys+Met
(QTLs #2, 6,7 and 9 on Gm08, 14, 19 and 20). Only two QTLs (QTLs #1 and 3 on Gm05 and 08) were unique
to a single trait (Cys and Met, respectively). The features of these nine QTLS are summarized in Table 2. The
portion of phenotypic variance explained (R?) varied between 15 and 27%. The magnitude ofallelic effects were
calculated according as per Kang et tal.28 and varied between 0.12 and 0.42 g/kg TP.
From the multi-locus analyses, 0.01% ofthe SNPS (36, 36 and 38 ofthe 243 K) were significantly associated
with Cys, Metand Cys+Met content, respectively. The LOD score ofthese associated SNPS rangedfrom 3.26to
17.65 for Cys, 3.05 to 18.98 for Met and 3.04 to 13.15 for Cys+ Met content. Across the six multi-locus methods
(Fig. 4), pKWmEB detected the fewest associated SNPS (0), while thehighest number was detected by pLARmEB
(14 SNPS associated with Cys content).
Here, we report QTNS that met the following criteria: (i) the associated SNP was detectedby at least two
multi-locus methods and (ii) explained at least 5% ofthe phenotypic variance (R?). In total, seventeen QTNS/
haplotype blocks were identified in this fashion including three QTNS codetected by both MLM land multi-locus
methods (Table S2). In most cases, using multi-locus methods, the exact same SNP was the mosthighly associ-
ated SNP with each trait, although occasionally, a different SNP residing in the same haplotype block was most
highly associated (e.g. Gm08: 43,871,472 for ISIS EM-BLASSO and Gm08: 43,877,254 for mrMLM).In the latter
case, tobe conservative, the SNP with the lowest LOD score was reported as the QTN.Of fthese seventeen QTNS,
four (Cys), three (Met) and five (Cys+ Met) were unique to a single trait. One QTN was shared by each oftwo

these multi-locus QTNS varied from 5.20 to 25.39% and the QTN effectvariedbetween 0.03 and 10.31 g/kg TP.
Each dot indicates the degree of association between a single marker and la trait (y-axis) while the x-axis shows
the physical position of each marker. A blue horizontal bar indicates the significance threshold (FDRS0.05)
and significantly associated markers are coloured in green. The red numbers (from 1 to 9)identify the different
QTLs based on the haplotype blocks formed by the significantly associated markers. The pink vertical stripes
highlight QTLs that were common to all three traits and the black arrows indicates the overlapped QTL between
MLM and multi-locus methods.
MLM QTL validation. To validate the QTLs discovered by the MLM method, data from three additional
trials were obtained. Given the difference in original purpose and experimental design ofthis secondsetoftrials,
the resulting data were used to assess ifthe phenotypic mean differed between lines carrying one or the other
allele at each QTL (Table S3). For Cys, seven out ofthe eight QTLs resulted in a significant difference (p<0.006)
in the mean Cys content between lines carrying contrasting alleles in at least one of the three validation trials.
Six out ofeightQTLs were validated in atleast two trials and five QTLs werevalidated in all three trials. For Met,
ofthe four QTLs discoveredinitially, all four were validated(p<0.01) in all trials. For Cys+Met, all seven QTNS
were validated (p <0.007) in at least one trial, six were confirmed in at least two trials and five were validated in
all three trials (Fig. 5). Together, these data strongly suggest that the QTLs identified through GWAS are robust
and highly reproducible across multiple environments.
Multi-locus QTN validation. To validate the QTNS discovered by the multi-locus methods, the same
approach and phenotypic data used for validation of MLM-derived QTLs was used. With the exception of
QTN_#7 in the OT_L2018 environment, unique QTNS (i.e. not including the three coinciding with QTLs) did
not produce a significant phenotypic contrast between lines carrying alternate alleles at these loci (Table S4).
Thus, we find that the QTNS discovered using a multi-locus model could seldom be validated using an approach
relying on the observation of phenotypic contrasts resulting from considering these loci individually.

Prediction of candidate genes within the QTL/haplotype blocks regions. To establish a list of
candidate genes, all genes residing within one of the haplotype blocks identified by MLM or the multi-locus
methods (ranging in size between 5 and 376 kb) were extractedfrom SoyBase and their GO annotations exam-
ined. The number ofgenes per haplotype block varied between land 32, and the full listofthese genes and their
annotations are provided lin Table S5. An example ofthis approachis illustratedin Fig. 6. Amongthese haplotype

EM-BLASSO, mrMLM andpLARMEB) corresponding to QTL #9 (MLM) and QTN #17 (multi-locus) spanned
64 kb and included 12 genes. Among these genes, Glyma.20g129700 was located 45 kb upstream of the MLM
peak SNP (Gm20: 37,038,638) and 35 kb upstream of the multi-locus peak SNP (Gm20: 37,049,294). This gene
was annotated as being involved in methionine biosynthesis (GO: 0009086). In addition, within haplotypes
identified from MLM analysis, only one other candidate gene had an annotation evoking an association with
sulfur amino acid content. Glyma.08g367600 is located 10.8 kb downstream ofthe peak SNP in QTL #4 (Gm08:
47,797,482), encodes a protein that is predicted to have an oxido-reductase activity and its annotation (GO:
0000096) suggests a role in sulfur amino acid metabolism.
Five other candidate genes were identified within four haplotype blocks identified only by the multi-
locus methods and correspond to QTNS #1, #10, #11 and #14 (Table 3). Among them, Glyma.13g108800,
Glyma.14g003200 and Glyma.14g003400 were all annotated as being involved in cysteine biosynthetis.
Glyma.13g108800 was found among 11 other genes in a 71-kb haplotype block and located 17 kb uptream of
the peak SNP corresponding to QTN #10 (Gm13: 22,275,813). The last two candidate genes were found within
ahaplotype block of 149 kb corresponding to QTN #11 and included 24 other genes. These were located 61 kb
and 50 kb downstream of the peak SNP (Gm14: 367,224).
Two other candidate genes, Glyma.04g237300 and Glyma.16g032200, hadan annotation indirectly associated
with the methionine biosynthesiss. They were located 43 kb and 23 kb uptream ofthe peak SNPS (QTN #1, Gm04:
50,542,407) and (QTN #14, Gm14: 3,028,024), respectively. Glyma.04g237300 was annotated to have a spermi-
dine synthase activity and found among 21 other genes in a 243-kb haplotype block while Glyma.16g032200
was located in a 56-kb haplotype block containing 6 genes and is annotated as being involved in ethylene
biosynthetiss.
We then investigated the expression profile ofthese seven candidate genes. Based on previous transcriptomic
analyses, these genes (except Glyma.08g367600) were known to be mainly expressedin young leaves, flowersand
roots but also expressed in pods 7 days after flowering (DAF), podshells (10-13 DAF) andin seeds (14-17 and
35 DAF) as illustrated in Figs. 7 and S4. There were no transcriptomic data available yet for the expression profile
ofGlyma.08g367600, likely due to the fact that it is present only in the current Wm82.a2 assembly/annotation.

seven candidate genes. All of these variants were predicted as having a "low" to "modifier" effect. As such, we do
not consider these variants to be likely causal.
Discussion
Phenotypic variation and correlations among traits. Normal distributions were observed for all the
traits (Shapiro test p-value <0.05) and suggested that these traits are controlled by polygenes. The phenotypic
variation ranged from 13.5 to 15.0 g/kg for Cys and from 12.6 to 13.6 g/kg for Met content. The total sulfur
amino acid content Cys + Met varied from 26.0 to 28.5 g/kg on the basis of total protein. The observed pheno-
typic values reported in this study were slightly lower but similar in range to those reported in previous studies
when similarly expressed in terms of g of amino acid per kg of total protein. Warrington et al. reported 14.8
to 16 g/kg and 13.9 to 14.7 g/kg for Cys and Met content. Song et al.19 reported 12.1 to 14.5 g/kg and 11.5 to
13.7 g kg respectively for Cys and Met contents. However, in terms of range, the results reported here corre-
spond most closely to those reported by (1.4 and 0.9 g/kg, respectively, for cysteine and methionine content).
Moreover, similarly to previous studies, high and positive correlations (0.81 to 0.97) were seen between cysteine,
methionine and the total sulfur amino acid contents. It has been suggested that the high phenotypic and/or
genotypic correlations between cysteine and methionine contents are due to a shared biosynthetic pathway or a
similar molecular basis of finheritance6.30.
Genome-wide association analysis. For marker-trait association analysis, a total of 243 K SNP mark-
ers and a single phenotypic value for each line (BLUP) was used in two GWAS approaches (one single-locus
(MLM) and six multi-locus (FASTmrEMMA, FASTmrMLM, ISIS EM-BLASSO, mrMLM; PLARmEB, and
pKWmEB) methods). In all cases, we incorporated population structure and family relatedness to control for
confounding effects. We reported a total of nine QTLs/haplotype blocks associated with the sulfur amino acid
content detectedby an MLM approach and seventeen major QTNS detected by at least two ofthe six multi-locus
methods. Interestingly, three chromosomalregions were detected using both approaches. Among MLM-derived
QTLS, one third ofthese SNPs were significantly associated with all three traits.
Importantly, approximately two thirds ofthese QTLs proved extremely robust as they could be successfully
confirmedin three additional trials. This suggests that these individual markers would provide a good tool for
breeders interested in using marker-assisted selection (MAS) to improve Cys and/or Met content within this
germplasm. In contrast, however, the QTNsuncovered in the multi-locus analysis could not bevalidatedin the
same fashion. One must keep in mind though that these QTNS were discovered in a model based on the joint
consideration ofthese loci whereas our validation experiment was based on the consideration oflociindividually.
This may have contributedto our inability to confirm the impact ofthe QTNS on these traits. Nonetheless, in the
context ofMAS, it is likely that these QTN would not prove useful; these might be better capturedin a genomic-
selection scheme relying on a wider set ofloci and allowing for multi-locus contributions to the phenotype.

In previous mapping work, the total number ofQTLs associated with cysteine andmethionine content varied
from 131 to 1417 in GWAS studies while 214 and8 QTLS32 were reported following family-based mapping. As we
observed here, a subset of QTLS were common to both cysteine and methionine content5.7,31 and, in one case, all
the QTLs (eight) were associated with both cysteine and methionine content32. This is unsurprising given the
high degree of correlation between these traits and the fact that both amino acids share the same biosynthetic
pathway with cysteine being aprecursor of methionine production".
To compare the genomic regions reportedby previous studies with the QTLs reportedin this study, we used
SoyBase to define the physical position of previously reported QTLs. Two of the three QTL/QTN codetected
by both approaches in this study fell within genomic intervals identified in previous biparental mapping work.
Indeed, Wang et al.32 reported one QTL Cys 3-7 located from 3.0 to 35.9 Mb on chromosome 20 associated
with seed cysteine content. Moreover, this genomic region fell within QTL qMet_Gm20 and qCys+ Met_Gm20
(24.5 to 34.7 Mb) reported by Warrington et al.3 associated with Met and Cys s+ Met content. Interestingly, this
genomic region overlapped with QTL #8 from MLM analysis and QTN #16 from multi-locus analysis located
on chromosome 20 at 31.8 Mb. Similarly, Ramamurthy et al.34 reported one QTL on chromosome 20 flanked
by BARC-038869-07364 and BARC-039753-07565 (36.5 to 39.8 Mb) simultaneously associated with both seed
Cys and Cys+Met content, an interval within resides a second codetected QTL, (QTL/QTN #9/#17 for MLM/
multi-locus) on chromosome 20 (Gm20, 37.0 Mb).
None ofthe seven other QTLs that we reported from MLManalysis in this study coincided with previously
reported QTLs intervals identified in family-based mapping. Similarly, none of fthe QTLs reported by previous
GWAS studies1731,35 were located within 500 kb of those reported in this study. Except for the work of Zhang
et al.31 in which only one QTLwasreported, all lother GWAS studies have been conducted within later maturity
groups (MG I-IX) and the limited overlap in QTLs could be attributed to differences in the loci controlling
these traits within the different maturity groups.
Considering that sulfur amino acids are components of protein fractions, notably the glycinin (11S) and con-
glycinin (7S) storage proteins, one might expect that genomic regions reported as significantly associated with
sulfur amino acid content also be associated with the abundance of11S and 17S, which together constitute nearly
70% of total storage proteins in the soybean seed'2. Interestingly, Ma et al.36 reported two QTLs significantly
associated with glycinin and beta-conglycinin content on chromosome 10 (174 kb and 2.7 Mb) and 20 (34.6
to 37.8 Mb) a genomic region spanning QTL #5 and #9 reported lin this study (Gm10 at 1.8 Mb) and (Gm20 at
37.0 Mb) significantly associated with all three traits.
For the multi-locus analyses, we reported a total of seventeen QTNS across twelve chromosomes including
three shared regions with the MLM method. Across the traits, three QTNS were detected for all three traits.
Two QTNS were sharedby two trait pairs (one each for Cys/Met and Met/Cys+ Met content). Four (Cys), three
(Met) and five (Cys s+Met) were unique to a single trait. Similar to the QTLs discovered via MLM, very little
overlap was observed between previously reported QTLs and the multi-locus QTNS identified in this study.
Among the seventeen QTNS, QTN #10 located on chromosome 13 (Gm13, 22.2 Mb) coincided with one QTL
reported by Qiu et al.11 to be significantly associated with cysteine content (flanked by BARC-042289-08234
and BARC-045205-08910,
Four of the QTNS reported in this study (QTN #1 and #2 at 48.4 and 50.5 Mb on Gm04; QTN #14 at 3.0 Mb
on Gm16 and QTN #17 at 37.0 Mb on Gm20) were significantly associated with all three traits andthese coincide
with three broad genomic regions reported by Ma et al.36 that were significantly associated with seed glycinin,
beta-conglycinin and seed glycinin to beta-conglycinin ratio content across three chromosomes (Gm04: 7.6 to
51.2 Mb, Gm16: 569 kb to 29.5 Mb and Gm20: 34.6 to 37.8 Mb).
Candidate genes and their functions for sulfur amino acid accumulation. The peak SNPS associ-
ated with sulfur amino acid content reside in the nine and seventeen haplotype blocks identified through MLM
and multi-locus analysis within which one would expect to find the causal genes that control Cys and Met con-
tent in this collection of soybean lines. Of the genes located within these haplotype blocks, seven stood out as
promising candidate genes based on their GO annotations.
Ofthese seven candidate genes, only Glyma.20g129700 was identified using both MLM and multi-locus
analysis and encodes a 5-methylthioribose kinase protein. This protein was demonstratedtobea) primary enzyme
involved lin the recycling of the methylthio group of 5-methylthioribose back into methioninew.as.
A second promising candidate gene identified using MLM, Glyma.08g367600, encodes a protein that is pre-
dicted to have an oxido-reductase activity acting on NAD(P)H. Although the annotation for this gene indicates
arole in sulfur amino acid metabolism, we have not been able to pinpoint the preciserole ofthe protein encoded
by this gene in sulfur amino acidmetabolism. Moreover, no information from previous studies or transcriptomic
data was available for this gene. Its role in the metabolism of sulfur amino acids needs to be confirmed.
Among the five other candidate genes identified from multi-locus analysis, Glyma.04g237300 was annotated
as a spermidine synthase and said to be involved in methionine synthesis in plants. From the work ofQiu let al.",
the spermidine synthase encoding gene was foundin association with eleven other genes to contribute6-38.5%
ofthe genetic variation of fsulfur-containing amino acids.
Glyma.13g108800 encode a stress-responsive alpha-beta barrel protein and is thought to be involved in both
cysteine and methionine synthesis under stress conditions. Cysteine-containing molecules like glutathione and
thioredoxin play a major role in maintaining an intracellular reducing environment and protecting the cell from
oxidative damage39.
Glyma.16g032200 encodes a protein that is involved in ethylene biosynthetis and in the L-methionine sal-
vage cycle II (in plants). The ortholog ofthis gene corresponds to the A. thaliana AT3G61510.1 locus, encoding

an ACC synthase 1. In plants, the methionine is a precursor of ethylene synthesis. Therefore, this biosynthetic
pathway is directly connected to the methionine cycle40,41.
Although Glyma.14g003200 and Glyma.14g003400 were both annotated as being involved in cysteine biosyn-
thesis, again, no directlink was found between these genes and cystheine biosynthesis through previous studies.
As none of the SNPs located inside the coding region of our candidate genes were predicted to cause a
functional change, it is likely that the alleles of this gene differ in expression, thus resulting in the observed
differences in sulfur-containing amino acids. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the phenotypic
variation observed in this collection of Canadian lines is due to variants located outside the coding region that
likely result in differences in gene expression.
Materials and methods
Plants material and field trials. A set of 137 lines thought to constitute a core set representative of the
extent of genetic diversity among soybean varieties belonging to maturity group 000-II ( MG000-II) in Canada
was selected from a larger group of 304 accessions based on the analysis of population structure as previously
describedin*. Plant research material was originally providedby four breeding programs, respectively CÉROM
at St-Mathieu-de-Beloeil (QC), Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada at Ottawa (ON), University of Guelph (ON)
and Semences Prograin Inc at St-Césaire (QC). These lines were grown in field trials conducted on two research
farms, namely Woodstock (ON, 43.1447° N, 80.7809° W) and St-Mathieu-de-Beloeil (QC, 45° 35' 14.1" N 73°
14' 59.6"W) in Canada in 2013. The experimental design was a generalized! lattice in which all llines were planted
in either 4-m rows with 50-cm spacing or 6-m rows with 30-inch spacing in Woodstock and St-Mathieu-Beloeil,
respectively, with two replicates at each site.
Phenotyping and statistical analysis. For sulfur amino acid content for both mapping and validation
population, 25-g samples (from each replicate) of whole seeds were analyzed using near-infrared spectroscopy
(Perten NIR DA 7250, Perten Instruments). The NIR used was calibrated according to manufacturer's calibra-
tion module based on set of 2646 samples. After sample scanning, the concentration of sulfur amino acids was
expressed on thebasis of the dry matter percentage. Each value was then normalized per kg oftotalprotein (g/kg
TP). Three traits were considered in the ensuing analyses: cysteine content(Cys), methionine content (Met) and
the sum ofboth (Cys+Met). Statistical analyses on amino acid content data were performed using META-R43.
Descriptive statistical analysis and a mixed linear model were used to determine genotypic variance, environ-
ment and genotypexenvironment effects as well as a Shapiro-Wilk test for normal distribution of the pheno-
type. The two sites were considered as two environments and all effects were assumed random, the broad-sense
heritability for a given trait across the two environments was calculated as follows:

where o2 2 and o 2 ge are the genotype and genotypexe environment interaction variance component, nEnv is the
number of environments,o? is error variance components nrep is the number of freplicates. Restricted maximum
likelihood was used to estimate the BLUP to provide a single value for each variety. Pearson's pairwise andgenetic
correlations among the traits were estimated using META-R, the genetic correlation was calculated using equa-
tions from Cooper and Delacy4

Genotyping and quality control. A total of- 203 million 100-bp Illumina HiSeq2000 single-end reads
derived from sequencing 192-plex GBS libraries were available for the 137 lines as described previously by42.
Briefly, DNA extraction was performed using the Qiagen DNeasy 96 Plant kit, The Apek1 restriction enzyme
was usedforlibrary preparation as per*5. These archived reads were processed anewto benefit from an improved
SNP-calling pipeline (Fast-GBS4) and a more recent annotation of the soybean genome Wm82.a2.v14. Geno-
types were called using a minimal read depth of two reads and loci with more than 80% missing data were
removed. Imputation was first performed on this catalogue of 56 K GBS-derived SNPS using BEAGLE v548 to fill
in any missing genotypes. We then used la set of 4.3 million SNPS derived from the whole-genome sequencing
of 102 Canadian elite soybean lines49 as a reference panel to impute all missing loci onto the initial catalogue
ofGBS-derived SNPS, again using BEAGLE (Fig. S1). Among these 102 resequencedlines, 56 were in common
with the association panel described above (i.e.>40% overlap). The accuracy of imputation of such untyped
loci was previously assessed50 and found to be 96.4%. After imputation of missing loci, VCFtools51 was used to
retain SNPS with a minor allele frequency (MAF)20.05 and heterozygositys0.1, thus producing a catalogue of
2.18 M SNPs.
Population structure. The resulting marker dataset was pruned by excluding SNPS in moderate linkage
disequilibrium (LD) (r2>0.5) using PLINKS to obtain a setof14K markers. Population structure was character-
ized using fastSTRUCTURES with the number of subpopulations (K) being set from 1 to 12 with 3 independ-

ent runs of each. The most likely K value was determined using a python script ("choosek") implemented in
fastSTRUCTURE based on the rate of change in LnP betweensuccessive K values. In order to better support the
number ofsub-populations, we used two additional tools: (i) abootstrap consensus phylogenetictree (2000 rep-
licates) was constructed using the maximum likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model implemented
in MEGA754; and (ii) a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using GAPITSS.
Genome-wide association analysis. Genome-wide association between markers and the phenotypes
was assessed in GAPIT and mrMLM R package v4.0 using a catalogue of 243 K SNPS and the best linear unbi-
ased predictors (BLUP) values for each trait. Two GWAS approaches includedone single-locus methods (MLM)
and six multi-locus (mrMLM; FASTmrMLM, PLARmEB, ISIS EM-BLASSO, FASTmrEMMA and pKWmEB)
methods were used. For significant SNP markers detection,asignificant threshold, FDRS0.05 andLOD23 were
used, respectively for MLM and multi-locus methods. To account for population structure and genetic related-
ness between the lines, we used the Q matrix obtained from fastSTRUCTURE and a K matrix (estimated using
the EMMA algorithm28) as covariates. To distinct different QTL/QTN, significantly associated SNPS from the
same genomic region were grouped together to form haplotype blocks, as per the LD-based method?7, using the
complete 2.18 MSNP catalogue. To be chosen as a haplotype block ofinterest, a block hadto contain atleast one
peak SNP significantly associated with sulfur amino acid content. The extent of each block was used to retrieve
all genes and their annotation.
Candidate genes and their functional analysis. Only genes residing within haplotype blocks contain-
ing a peak SNP were extracted from SoyBase and were examined for their GO annotations. In order to provide
more information about potential candidate genes, the electronic fluorescent pictograph (eFP) Browser (www.
bar.utoronto.ca) for soybeans was used to identify in what tissues and at which developmental stages candidate
genes were expressed (based on the transcriptomic data of Severin et al.56 We also looked for potential loss-
of-function (LOF) alleles among the list of candidate genes by inspecting the catalogue of structural variants
reported by Torkamaneh et al.57 and by examining the predicted impact of the full set of nucleotide variants
locatedwithin genic regions using SnpEff 58. The search for such LOF alleles was limitedto the 56lines for which
WGS data were available.
