Abstract
Keymessage A locus on chromosome 13, containing multiple TIR-NB-LRR genes and SNPS associated with M.javan-
ica resistance, was identified using a combination of GWAS, resequencing, genetic mapping and expression profiling.
Abstract Meloidogyne) javanica, aroot-knot nematode, is an important problem in soybean-growing areas, leading to severe
yield losses. Some accessions have been identified carrying resistance loci to this nematode. In this study, a set of 317 soy-
bean accessions was characterized for resistance to M. javanica. A genome-wide association study was performed using
SNPs from genotypingeby-sequencing and a region of 29.2 kb on chromosome 13 was identified. An analysis of haplotypes
showed that SNPs were able to discriminate between susceptible and resistant accessions, with 25 accessions sharing the
haplotype associated with resistance. Furthermore, five accessions that exhibited resistance without carrying this haplotype
may carry different loci conferring resistance to M. javanica. We also conducted the screening of the SNPS in the USDA
soybean germplasm, revealing that several soybean accessions previously reported as resistant to other nematodes also shared
the resistance haplotype on chromosome 13. Two SNP-based TaqMane assays were developed and validated in two panels
of soybean cultivars and in biparental populations. In silico analysis of the region associated with resistance identified the
occurrence of genes with structural similarity with classical major resistance genes (NBS-LRR genes). Specifically, several
nonsynonymous SNPs were observed in Glyma.13g194800 and Glyma.13g/94900. The expression profile of these candidate
genes demonstrated that the two gene models were up-regulated in the resistance source PI 505,099 after nematode infec-
tion. Overall, the SNPS associated with resistance and the genes identified constitute an important tool for introgression of
resistance to the root-knot nematode by marker-assisted selection in soybean breeding programs.
