Fig. 3 Origin of soybean domestication in China. (a) Latitude and longitude distribution of fully domesticated (FD) soybean accessions in China. These
accessions were classified to three hypothetical regionsin China. FD1 (orange points) represents the soybean groups from southern China (south of the
Qinling Mountains and Huai River, including both sides of the Yangtze River), FD2 (purple points) represents the soybean groups from the Huang-Huai
Valley (between the Great Wall and Qinling Mountains, including both sides ofthe Yellow River), and FD3 (dark and light red points) represents the
soybean groups from northeastern China (north of the Great Wall). (b) Differentiation ofthe three geographical groups of FD based on the first two
